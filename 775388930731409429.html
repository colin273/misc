<p>Darjeeling vs Miho is a match made in unconventional, guerrilla warfare heaven. 
Although I’d say experience and perception are what separates the two. </p>
<p>Darjeeling strikes me as a Napoleonic Grand Strategist, planning two or three moves ahead, and as if playing a game of chess, aims to control the center of the board. </p>
<p>Miho is more of a Rommel-type, she has outlined the battle and attempts to place it into a framework that she’s familiar with, allowing adjustment to occur more frequently as the opponent counterattacks, making many of her judgements reactionary.</p>
<p>I can sum up Darjeeling’s reactions to Miho’s tactics with one quote:</p>
<p>"Never interrupt your enemy in the middle of making a mistake." </p>
<p>– Napoleon Bonaparte</p>

<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-10T00:30:35.091000+00:00</p>
<p>Darjeeling uses the Segmentation tactic <strong>masterfully</strong>, and it’s a joy to watch it onscreen. By segmenting Miho’s forces, she creates disorder and chaos within the ranks, allowing a brief moment she can then exploit to isolate and eliminate them.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-10T00:32:19.939000+00:00</p>
<p>Let’s go back to StG’s encirclement during Der Film. </p>
<p>Darjeeling remained reticent and composed throughout the entire battle, but <em>especially</em> during their encirclement at the defilade. What was Miho’s plan? Encircle them and shoot the flag tank, game over? </p>
<p>In theory, this could’ve worked, but it was far too parochial in a strategic sense. What of Pravda? Surely their forces would arrive at any moment, did she have a contingency for this? </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Darjeeling anticipated the arrival of Pravda, whilst simultaneously utilizing Chi-Ha-Tan’s propensity for mindless advances. She knew Chi-Ha-Tan would grow overconfident and would advance, giving her forces the opportunity to eliminate as many of Chi-Ha-Tan’s tanks as possible, creating a salient to spur a breakthrough, in concert with Pravda’s arrival. </p>
<p>She knew Miho would <em>have</em> to move, the threat was too real. She utilized the 15th, 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th, and 22nd strategies of war. Control the Dynamic, Defeat Them in Detail, Expose and Attack Your Opponent’s Soft Flank, Envelop the Enemy, Maneuver Them Into Weakness, and Know How to End Things, respectively.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-10T00:34:05.909000+00:00</p>
<p>I would not be the least bit surprised if it was Darjeeling’s plan to nestle in that defilade from the very start. Assam might make all of the computational calculations, but Darjeeling is the one making the Grand Strategic ones. Feint weakness in order to make your opponent overconfident: Chi-Ha-Tan.</p>
<p>Darjeeling knew Miho’s bread and butter was urban warfare, the battle would eventually make its way to the city, and she was <strong>banking</strong> on this. This is defeating them in detail. She orchestrated this Symphony of Destruction in order to maneuver Ooarai into a position of weakness, she made every option Miho could choose from a <strong>bad</strong> one. </p>
<p>The crescendo came when she enveloped them at the beach, knowing Miho would decide to counterattack by sieging and attempting a daring breakthrough to go straight for the flag tank.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-10T00:35:03.258000+00:00</p>
<p>ou think Darjeeling watches all of Ooarai’s matches simply because of her admiration for them? Of course not! She’s gathering intel. She’s writing her magnum opus in her head each time she goes to see Ooarai in combat. I think Darjeeling is the most cunning of the commanders.</p>
<p>I think the Matilda’s are a feint. She’s well aware of Ooarai’s mobility due to their utilization of light tanks, with the exception of the Tiger (P), but that’s moving like a light tank because of the automotive club’s custom modifications to it. </p>
<p>She’s seen how KMM fights, and how they lost to Ooarai, their heavy tanks were not supplemented by a sufficient amount of medium and light tanks. She allows Miho to make the first move in order to give her the sense that she has control over the battle, most likely even allowing StG to be whacked around by Ooarai.</p>
<p>I believe Darjeeling struggles against other commanders in general because she <em>gasp</em> doesn’t try her best. She takes a laissez-faire approach knowing full well her tanks couldn’t hope to graze the skin of a Tiger II let alone a Jagdtiger or a Maus.</p>

<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T01:02:00.756000+00:00</p>
<p>I think in the Der Film opening match that perhaps Miho waited way too long to move in. Time is of the essence, and it is time that Darjeeling is using to her advantage. Obviously you can't just charge in with a few tanks, as we saw Chi-Ha-Tan do with terrible results. But even if you move forwards to get into firing positions, you don't just sit there talking about tea and milkshakes. That St. Gloriana was not returning too much fire should have been a cue to Miho that they were just biding their time.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T01:04:54.479000+00:00</p>
<p>It is my opinion that the Ooarai/Chi-Ha-Tan main force could have moved in as a unit as soon as the Churchill was pinned down. That was just a small number of tanks in that sand trap, which would have been no match for a much more vicious kind of assault.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T01:06:37.422000+00:00</p>
<p>I question why Miho didn't make more use of the tank destroyers sitting around the other side. Those could have come in much more handy, but instead they were just sitting ducks for the incoming Crusaders.</p>
<hr />

<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T01:08:49.049000+00:00</p>
<p>Move to a better firing position, then begin firing. Even though the firing and reloading mechanism consisting of Assam and Orange Pekoe is fast and efficient, it shouldn't be able to fight off a precise hull-down barrage. And if that doesn't work, well, that force actually has the might needed to make a mass charge work in that situation simply by overwhelming the Matildas and the Churchill.</p>

<p>Absolutely. I actually think Miho was beginning to catch on when Chi-Ha-Tan decided to charge forward, forcing her to reconsolidate her forces. It’s absurd that Miho didn’t utilize any of her TD’s to eliminate the flag tank that was just goddamned <strong>sitting there</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-10T01:10:24.344000+00:00</p>
<p>When Pravda arrived and forced them to disperse, the battle was all but lost. The initiative was gone and the dynamic of battle had shifted from their favor.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T01:11:24.187000+00:00</p>
<p>I think that in that case Miho would have been better off rolling with the punches and charging in with Chi-Ha-Tan. This would have preserved unit strength and allowed them to overwhelm the St. Gloriana infantry tanks while simultaneously running from Pravda.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T01:12:17.612000+00:00</p>
<p>As soon as the unit broke, it was over.</p>

<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-10T01:12:38.352000+00:00</p>
<p>Hmm, yes. That could’ve worked. They honestly should have just charged forward, losses be damned, they had the initiative. All that needed to be done was to land a shot on the Churchill and the match would have been over.</p>

<p>Once the encirclement was complete, Miho should’ve called all units in to deal as much damage possible to that defilade. Just the StuG, Tiger, and Pz.IV shooting into there would’ve landed a kill blow on the Churchill.</p>

<p>I think they made a reasonable choice deploying the Tiger to the defensive line--but they didn't need it to stay there to the bitter end. They have the capacity to bring it from Point A to Point B in just seconds flat, so they could have made use of that. Mallard Team and the two Chi-Ha-Tan tanks were, cruel as it sounds, expendable. Only the Tiger could really deal much damage to the Pravda tanks.</p>

<p>Now, as for Katyusha's decision to take the defenses head-on, I question that. She could have just gone around, as Klara (I think) pointed out, then sent a detachment to overwhelm and destroy the hapless defenders while the rest of her force rushed in to destroy the Ooarai/Chi-Ha-Tan team from behind.</p>

<p>YES! Oh my good gracious, I was tearing my hair out at Katyusha lol. They could very well have encircled the encirclement, <strong>then</strong> Ooarai would truly have been fucked, being sandwiched in between Pravda and StG with the Crusaders inbound.</p>

<p>So now we get to something Miho said: "It will take some time for their detached force to arrive." What was she referring to there? Pravda? Or the Crusaders? (Since the TD crews seemed a bit confused when the Crusaders came in--"It looks like a crab!")</p>

<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T01:28:08.672000+00:00</p>

<p>This is why I think that it was part of Darjeeling’s plan the entire time. It had to have been, since the alternatives would result in Ooarai getting spooked and pushing in on the Churchill.

<p>Sure, Chi-Ha-Tan pressed their advantage too far. But Miho, master of the unexpected, was caught with her pants down and got fucked in the ass by a patience-based strategy to weaken her force.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-10T01:39:13.694000+00:00</p>
<p>I agree, <em>especially</em> with the latter half. She should have realized that the Churchill was firing far too infrequently for a flag tank that was encircled.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-10T01:40:03.209000+00:00</p>
<p>Even Maho points out her little sister’s complacency later on in the film saying that she was becoming far too rigid and fighting less like herself.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T01:42:10.304000+00:00</p>
<p>Indeed. That was a very appropriate wakeup call for Miho.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T01:42:47.717000+00:00</p>
<p>In the latter part of the opening match, Miho starts to get back into the zone of fighting.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-10T01:43:09.035000+00:00</p>
<p>Too little too late.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T01:44:15.388000+00:00</p>
<p>Her whole style depends on rolling with the punches and punishing the enemy with their own advantages. Unfortunately she loses a sizable part of her force to a single blunder in what could have been the endgame.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T01:45:53.907000+00:00</p>
<p>The problem is that she repeats the same move she pulled on Kuromorimine—which Darjeeling and Katyusha have already seen from the crowd!</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-10T01:46:15.975000+00:00</p>
<p>Exactly!</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T01:46:16.351000+00:00</p>
<p>That is another major blunder.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T01:47:03.456000+00:00</p>
<p>The St. Gloriana/Pravda team, by taking the nearer turn, can flank them with ease.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T01:48:08.818000+00:00</p>
<p>And flank them they do, throwing Miho’s force into more disarray as Miho is forced to split off.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T01:49:20.975000+00:00</p>
<p>Probably one of Miho’s best moves there was using Mallard Team to deal with the Crusaders. This method of using the whole tank as a weapon is something that I think many commanders overlook.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-10T01:51:21.420000+00:00</p>
<p>Yes that was a brilliant move by Miho. Physical contact with two tanks deliberately is seldom seen or utilized, and often should, especially with the size of these vehicles. Imagine if the Tiger (P) was pushing Matildas around haha.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T01:52:02.327000+00:00</p>
<p>And then subsequently directing her own tank away from the path the Char B1 had cleared was a nice way to gain a couple seconds of time--but Katyusha was sharp and sent her tanks after it without wasting time.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T01:53:20.254000+00:00</p>
<p>Here Miho's skill as an individual tank commander comes into play.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T01:58:40.508000+00:00</p>
<p>She gets lucky on more than one occasion, since she knows the town like the back of her hand.</p>
<p>Probably my favorite moment in that battle is how Miho deals with the Crusaders. She uses a simple unexpected turnaround to catch them off guard after a high-speed chase, using the same kind of mind game that Darjeeling pulled on her. Then Hana's gunnery skills allow her to pick off a second one as they retreat. Definitely not a strategy for an inexperienced crew, but it works in that case. But by far the smartest thing Miho does in the battle is stopping as the last two bring their guns to bear while overtaking her. It's simple and there's no real counter for it, at least not one that Rosehip would think of.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T02:01:45.994000+00:00</p>
<p>Rosehip could have just kept moving instead of stopping. If you're in a tank designed for speed and agility, the last thing you want to do is make yourself a sitting duck.</p>

<p><@681496279486038028> 
Contrary to what Shiho may think, I think Miho is not only the living embodiment of the Nishizumi Style, but the next logical evolution of the style. </p>
<p>Miho, from what I’ve seen, is still utilizing the Nishizumi Style, but adapted to excel within the confines of Ooarai’s humble fleet of tanks. </p>
<p>Of course that’s not to say she hasn’t embellished it with her own unique qualities and skill set, but at its core, she’s still utilizing at the very least, the basic of the Nishizumi Style. </p>
<p>Miho’s brilliance lies in the counterattack, and she will wait for the opponent to make the first move if she must, in order to glean whatever information she needs about their formations and maneuvers.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T02:27:47.441000+00:00</p>
<p>Something we see quite often is that Miho is terrible at taking the initiative in the proper way. This is probably because when she has carte blanche on what she does, she gets caught up in indecisiveness and tends to make shoddy decisions. However, when there is the pressure of an attack, what she needs to do suddenly appears before her eyes. Constraints lead to the best creativity.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T02:28:44.502000+00:00</p>
<p>When it comes to taking the initiative in combat, the more powerful team will naturally be better able to do this. They are using vehicles specifically designed for taking the initiative.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T02:30:24.432000+00:00</p>
<p>This is why Miho's tactics depend so heavily on lures--her team is simply too weak to pull off an assault against a large, powerful force.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T02:31:19.713000+00:00</p>
<p>And, as we see later in Der Film, Alice knows this. She tells her forces to stand down on shooting the "Acorn Platoon," knowing that their frontal charge is not an actual attack on her tank.</p>

<p>Going on the offensive is much more difficult than being on the defensive. You have more options on the defense. You can force the enemy into a war of attrition, starve them out. Seek an opportunity for a counterattack. Appear from where you’re not expected and expose their rear, disrupting their lines. In order to make any offensive meaningful, the push must be relentless and swift.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-10T02:37:03.571000+00:00</p>
<p>Having Carte Blanche, among other things, is what damn near fucked Ooarai in the match with Pravda. She should have interjected, and stuck with her intuition, rather than giving in to the demands of people who’d never even done Sensha-Dō before.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T02:40:02.748000+00:00</p>
<p>When Ooarai came out of the church, guns blazing, that was an excellent counterattack--right where Katyusha did not expect, right into the crucial center that must remain unbroken in a setup like that. (Miho could have theoretically just stormed the flag tank's position, seeing as the KV-2 has a terrible gunner, but she had no way to know that and so wasn't going to take chances.) The options were very clear, and with the sense of desperation that her team had, they were willing to fight like hell to get out of there.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T02:40:31.079000+00:00</p>
<p>But the early attack…my, my, that was abysmal.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T02:41:39.476000+00:00</p>
<p>Katyusha put up outposts--both to delay the Ooarai advance, and probably also so that she could get very accurate updates as to the timing of Ooarai's movements from the crews. This gave her time to discern exactly what her inexperienced opponents were doing.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T02:42:24.712000+00:00</p>
<p>So she set up an ambush that could have been an instant victory if not for Katyusha's arrogance.</p>

<p>That early attack was one of the clumsiest, uncoordinated attacks I’d ever seen. If Miho hadn’t seen that church, it would’ve been over. </p>
<p>You would think that with having fought Pravda before at Kuromorimine, she would have some clue as to how Katyusha arranges and utilized her forces. </p>
<p>In fact, it was a foolish decision on Katyusha’s part to leave a salient open in the hopes that Ooarai would exploit it, because by that point, Miho would’ve wised up and seen that as a feint. </p>
<p>If I was Katyusha, I would’ve ordered the tightening of the encirclement, making sure that it was fastened at all points, and ordered all guns to concentrate on the opening of the church. As soon as Ooarai even sneezes coming out of the church, they’ll fall like ninepins.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T02:52:05.529000+00:00</p>
<p>I personally think Katyusha should have made better use of that KV-2. It could be used to force Ooarai out of the church and right into a wall of shells.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T02:52:39.270000+00:00</p>
<p>Instead, though, she put her most useful anti-building weapon in a position to defend a tank.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T02:53:02.250000+00:00</p>
<p>That was a massive blunder on her part, stemming from the fact that she gives its crew too much credit for their abilities.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T02:54:50.874000+00:00</p>
<p>Even if you can't hit a tank very well, you can probably be reasonably successful at shooting the church. This would start creating the conditions where the Ooarai team's choice is to get caught under a caving-in structure or fight their way out in an unwinnable assault.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-10T03:01:03.096000+00:00</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is absolutely what Katyusha should have done. What misuse of such a potent weapon. One of the keys in ensuring your success and the opponent’s defeat is to place them in a position where effectively, every decision they make is <em>bad</em> one. </p>
<p>Should Ooarai advance, they risk scuttling their entire column, should they remain inert, they would be lose instantly once a large enough piece of the church falls onto the flag tank and damages it.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T03:06:55.441000+00:00</p>
<p>But Katyusha, going on her prior experience in the tournament, is so assured of her own invincibility against such a weak lineup that she thinks she can afford to do what she does. <em>Spoiler alert: you can never assume anything about the enemy except that they are trying to kill you.</em> She decides that she will be able to make it a protracted siege, knowing that her tank crews came prepared to hunker down, and that an inexperienced team probably did not know to do this. (Only Yukari did.)</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T03:09:04.368000+00:00</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Katyusha has no way of knowing how losing the previous tournament has impacted Miho.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T03:09:54.602000+00:00</p>
<p>Instead of solidifying in Miho's mind that she's incompetent, as Katyusha probably expects, it gives Miho something to rise above. And so against everything Katyusha expected, Miho rallies her team.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T03:12:18.791000+00:00</p>
<p>And connecting this back to the opening battle of Der Film, this mistake that Katyusha makes in the tournament semifinals, getting complacent and taking a nap while waiting for the clock to run down or something, is <em>exactly</em> the same one that Miho makes in the compound match.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T03:12:50.775000+00:00</p>
<p>Darjeeling saw it too.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T03:13:51.687000+00:00</p>
<p>The difference is that in the tournament match, Katyusha literally handed the Ooarai team time on a silver platter. In the exhibition match, it's a calculated part of the course of the battle.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-10T03:14:39.972000+00:00</p>
<p>Katyusha knows how she misused those three precious hours of time, and so does Darjeeling. So they lull Miho into making the same mistake.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T05:28:44.885000+00:00</p>
<p>Besides Darjeeling, one of the most intriguing commanders in GuP is Marie. She doesn't win the match she fights against Ooarai--but she very well could have at several points, and is very much in tune with the entire mechanism of Sensha-dō, its purpose, and the parts of it that other teams might gloss over.</p>
<p>Marie is possibly one of the most charismatic of all, up there with Darjeeling and Miho in terms of being adored by her team. She manages to unite two warring sides of the recently fused school, turning mortal enemies into allies with the rather ingenious taiyaki stunt that symbolically bridged the gap.</p>
<p>She is very much an Escalator student, but at the same time she isn't like the others. Sure, she is extremely self-indulgent, far more so than literally anyone else in GuP (after all, she is based on the French nobility in the years leading up to the French Revolution!), but at the same time, for all her habits she is the only one willing to work with everyone.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T05:29:05.130000+00:00</p>
<p>And it is by working with everyone at BC Freedom that her strategy starts, even days before the battle takes place.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-29T05:29:52.571000+00:00</p>
<p>Marie is an expert at the art of negotiating</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T05:30:11.972000+00:00</p>
<p>We see that Marie, for as ridiculous as she makes her image, is also extremely perceptive.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-29T05:30:12.403000+00:00</p>
<p>She brokers a peace between the two sides while making it seem almost like it was their idea.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T05:31:18.140000+00:00</p>
<p>She reminds me of Napoleon to startling degree.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T05:31:21.471000+00:00</p>
<p>In a way, it partially was--they were pushing the components, and she fused it together into one thing. She uses what looks for a moment like humility (since when does Marie have that?) and brings them together.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-29T05:31:53.210000+00:00</p>
<p>Her style is totally based on that of Napoleon</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T05:32:23.214000+00:00</p>
<p>I am going to choose to believe so as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T05:32:38.797000+00:00</p>
<p>Like Darjeeling, she is good with strategy. The difference, as I see it, lies primarily in the fact that Darjeeling's methods rely on a great deal more patience than Marie's do.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T05:35:29.415000+00:00</p>
<p>She is able to exploit a major weakness in Ooarai's methods--once people start to get used to you, they have a much easier time reading you.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T05:35:53.287000+00:00</p>
<p>And the most obvious of these is Yukari.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T05:36:39.658000+00:00</p>
<p>Remember when she was surrounded by Ooarai and defeat was all but certain? She nonchalantly took a bite of cake. This is almost completely in parallel to Napoleon's own nonchalant jests to his marshals even when the Battle of Waterloo was already obviously lost, he was still joking that he'd have to save the champagne for another occasion.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T05:36:40.080000+00:00</p>
<p>It is a known fact by the time of the Continuous Track Cup that a certain girl with fluffy hair shows up mysteriously posing as a transfer student before matches.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T05:37:47.877000+00:00</p>
<p>Probably the most sporting way to go about defeat anyway--don't be a sore loser and spazz out. Instead see what you can learn from it.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T05:38:38.647000+00:00</p>
<p>Marie maintains her composure even when she can see her troops fighting amongst themselves. I believe that she was indeed based on Napoleon's character.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T05:40:01.640000+00:00</p>
<p>Her habits are total French nobility, but her methods are Napoleon through and through.</p>
<p>But anyway, back to the spying mission. Marie's timing is impeccable with the taiyaki stunt. Not only has she won over both sides of the school, so they're still enthusiastic, but she also has perfect ammunition to deceive the inevitable spy.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T05:40:51.373000+00:00</p>
<p>(Also, manga and Yukari fans like to make Yukari out to be an expert spy…but the anime makes no bones about the fact that she's possibly the worst spy in all of fiction.)</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T05:48:36.662000+00:00</p>
<p>I cannot help but draw parallels to Napoleon when analyzing Marie's strategic intuition. Napoleon, with almost frightening mathematical accuracy, could say that the battle would commence in fifteen minutes on the dot, and end in three hours and eight minutes, and his timing was unmatched. Marie conducted the Taiyaki War just the same way, knowing exactly where Yukari would appear, at what time she would be there, and would initiate her deception masterfully.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T05:49:42.070000+00:00</p>
<p>She orchestrated the initial half of the match against Ooarai masterfully, and came alarmingly close to winning. Of course, she also took advantage of Miho and Ooarai's complacency.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T05:50:35.674000+00:00</p>
<p>With the deception, she was able to make Ooarai completely rule out the possibility of what she was going to do--so no matter what they guessed they would be wrong.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T05:51:17.720000+00:00</p>
<p>She kept up the deception as long as possible.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T05:51:26.418000+00:00</p>
<p>The moment the battle began, I could already see the same plays being made by Ooarai that had made them famous.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T05:53:58.593000+00:00</p>
<p>They moved in a wedge formation with the flanks well-screened by lots of guns, protecting the weakest of these, Shark Team, with the others. A fairly sound method, yes, but very predictable.</p>
<p>Instead of going to seek them out and attack them, the two companies of BC Freedom tanks just led the reconnaissance tanks around by the nose. I'm sure they were well aware of the fact that they were being tailed, but they were probably under orders to pretend they had no idea.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T05:54:38.295000+00:00</p>
<p>After all, Marie needed Leopon and Duck Teams to report something back that suggested that the BC Freedom team was still split.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T05:55:26.348000+00:00</p>
<p>Only when there had been more than enough time for that did the recon tanks come under fire from the BC Freedom tanks, most likely because Marie gave them the go-ahead to open fire.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T05:55:47.823000+00:00</p>
<p>It reminds me of Rumi's force in Der Film--they don't need to take out the recon tanks.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T05:55:56.599000+00:00</p>
<p>They just need to tie them down while the others get into position.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T05:56:53.022000+00:00</p>
<p>(Oh, and sending Leopon Team to scout was a terrible idea in my opinion. That's a heavy tank, not a recon vehicle.)</p>

<p>I was actually just about to address that.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T06:03:22.568000+00:00</p>
<p>I think Miho may have been taken by the idea of the additional speed bestowed upon the Tiger (P) by the Automotive Club and attempted to use it to scout ahead. However I also think she was securing their wider flanks by having a heavy out there to close in on the BC Freedom tanks should they be surrounded; this is speculative at best, because I don't think Miho was expecting BC Freedom to be able to envelop them to begin with, but it may have been a subconscious decision to allow the Tiger to disrupt BC Freedom's lines should the need arise. </p>
<p>Using the recon tanks to send mixed signals to Miho was an excellent tactic by Marie. It did remind me of Rumi in Der Film. Make a sound in the East, strike in the West.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:05:57.203000+00:00</p>
<p>Based on Miho's Kuromorimine training, I think she would have been more likely to keep Leopon Team close to the formation, where its armor protection and firepower could really do a lot of good if the formation was attacked. Momo was the one to call on Duck and Leopon to scout if I recall, and Miho just went with it, saying something to the effect of "I think that's a great idea!" so as not to appear like she's trying to control Momo.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:07:20.556000+00:00</p>
<p>Ooarai suffers from a serious issue in that match: chain of command.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T06:07:33.349000+00:00</p>
<p><strong>Yes</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:07:34.651000+00:00</p>
<p>On one hand, Momo is the official commander, so all decisions have to go through her.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:07:51.068000+00:00</p>
<p>But on the other, Momo knows she's terrible, so she defers to Miho on basically everything.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:08:26.713000+00:00</p>
<p>Meanwhile Miho doesn't want to get in the way of Momo getting credit, so this makes her less willing to opt for tactical prudence.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T06:09:29.829000+00:00</p>
<p>Strength in the Chain of Command is paramount to success. If you're looking to employ the use of the Auftragstaktik, you have to have competent Generals that can move independently to great success, unfortunately Momo does not fit within this category.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:09:33.444000+00:00</p>
<p>Miho is the de facto commander, but she's not trying her hardest. She reverts to stuff she learned way back when at Kuromorimine.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T06:09:53.780000+00:00</p>
<p>And the Nishizumi Style, whether she likes it or not.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:12:23.030000+00:00</p>
<p>Momo goes for the "Let's go attack right away!" strategy…<em>now hmm, where have I seen this before? Where did wanting to just go attack nearly lose you a match? Was it in the snow, Momo? Somewhere in Russia in subzero temperatures?</em></p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:12:56.584000+00:00</p>
<p>I forget who suggested recon.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T06:13:45.746000+00:00</p>
<p>Miho should have put her foot down during that match. She knew full well how capable Pravda was.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T06:14:13.571000+00:00</p>
<p>They damn near froze to death due to "enthusiasm."</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:14:15.876000+00:00</p>
<p>Indeed. But she just wanted to have fun with it for once.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:14:23.327000+00:00</p>
<p><em>So much for that…</em></p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:14:35.273000+00:00</p>
<p>Anyway…</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:16:07.783000+00:00</p>
<p>In the BC Freedom match, Ooarai sends its lightest tank and its heaviest tank out to go find the enemy. But what are they doing while waiting for input? Are they finding a good position to hide in? Or are they moving out in the open waiting to get shot?</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:16:32.200000+00:00</p>
<p>This is something that schools like Ooarai cannot do.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:17:57.042000+00:00</p>
<p>While it impacts nothing in the end, as Marie is having her forces continue to deceive the reconnaissance efforts, there are probably a good many inexperienced teams that would have attacked the formation while it was in the open.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T06:18:35.835000+00:00</p>
<p>Precisely. Ooarai has always been renowned for its ability to move at a moment's notice and appear in places they were not expected. I would expect Kuromorimine's tank destroyers to remain static. It is again as you have pointed out, due to a relaxed Miho, and a questionable chain of command.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:20:38.197000+00:00</p>
<p>Once there was a line of sight to the Ooarai team coming from a very predictable route, all BC Freedom had to do was wait for the right moment to suddenly stop playing petanque.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T06:20:53.152000+00:00</p>
<p>The reliance on reconnaissance was far too much for my liking, from Yukari's foot recon, to the recon teams in the match. It was far too safe and lax, especially for Miho.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T06:21:37.417000+00:00</p>
<p>It actually seemed like she was somewhat glad to relinquish some of the duties of command, if only by name, to Momo for a time.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:22:11.224000+00:00</p>
<p>Probably a relief from having the weight of the world on her shoulders for over a year.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T06:27:13.917000+00:00</p>
<p>Miho never struck me as the ambitious, glory hound. She felt it was her obligation to her friends and her school, and nothing more. Even as her confidence as an Overall Commander grew, she still had difficulty making public addresses to the teams. She was probably glad to just enjoy Sensha-Dou again, then the Momo situation arises and now there are stakes again, something is once again on the line and their success depends on her abilities, but I don't think she fully realize how vital she was to the strategic efforts at Ooarai, for even though we have seen Momo take interest in strategy before, she simply doesn't possess the gift of foresight and intuition that any strategist must have.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:30:06.249000+00:00</p>
<p>I don't think Miho was expecting it to be too much of an issue--but then it suddenly was when they came under fire.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T06:30:12.088000+00:00</p>
<p>"There are certain things in war of which the commander alone comprehends the importance. Nothing but his superior firmness and ability can subdue and surmount all difficulties."</p>

</ul>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T06:32:23.886000+00:00</p>
<p>That quote above is exactly the predicament that Miho found herself in. There was no one else on the Sensha-Do teams that could match her strategic acuity. I think that coming under fire on that bridge finally snapped her up and brought her <em>full</em> attention to the battle at hand.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:36:17.058000+00:00</p>
<p>And with that in mind, the approach to the enemy was not one of Ooarai's finest moments, to say the least. The bridge was a very predictable route (and the fact that it's a copy of the one from <em>The Bridge on the River Kwai</em> ought to be a bit of a red flag if you ask me!), one that narrowed down the possible points of approach to just one.</p>
<p>Additionally, there was a thing that American tankers were taught, and that was that you never pack a column together. Even if the enemy gets one tank, they'll have a hard time getting the others. Miho has the tanks all move across the bridge at once, probably to improve the speed of their attack since they're moving at a snail's pace for noise reasons--but this clusters them all together, a nice sitting duck.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:37:34.765000+00:00</p>
<p>By the time Sodoko gets the sense that something's off, it's too late and not soon enough--all the tanks are on the bridge, and none have managed to get off.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:38:27.175000+00:00</p>
<p>I would definitely not want to be Mallard Team when their tank nearly falls with the collapsing sector of bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:38:41.350000+00:00</p>
<p>That has to be a very disorienting experience.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T06:39:50.308000+00:00</p>
<p>Oh without a doubt. There'd be a few sleepless nights thanks to that.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T06:44:53.898000+00:00</p>
<p>As soon as I saw them moving across the bridge in a column, not unlike British tank columns that were massacred by German tanks hiding at some tree line somewhere, I knew that that was going to be a turkey shoot for BC Freedom. Marie utilized the 18th and 19th Strategies of War meticulously and impeccably, being "Expose and Attack Your Opponent's Soft Flank" and "Envelop the Enemy," respectively.</p>
<hr />

<p>The hilltop command position (another Napoleon special!) had a dual purpose: that, and to purposely show off BC Freedom's flag tank to the enemy so they would seek out an attack on an obvious apparent weakness.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:47:42.914000+00:00</p>

<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T06:49:36.501000+00:00</p>
<p>This should have been concerning to Miho much much earlier than it was.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:52:08.837000+00:00</p>
<p>I think she was banking on the notion that a team that had never gotten far, like BC Freedom, was supposedly unlikely to employ anything sophisticated.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:52:58.172000+00:00</p>
<p>It's as if she didn't realize the lesson she taught to the world: anything can happen, no matter how small the school.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:53:31.655000+00:00</p>
<p>Now, Ooarai could have used the bridge to go attack--but not like that.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:53:49.526000+00:00</p>
<p>They should have sent them across one or two at a time, securing a position.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:54:20.481000+00:00</p>
<p>This would have been a lot harder for BC Freedom to deal with unless they completely changed their plans and went to stop the Ooarai advance, which would in turn give up the entire scheme.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:55:50.956000+00:00</p>
<p>It's no good to be on your guard when you are at the mercy of a bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:56:48.082000+00:00</p>
<p>But as it is, Ooarai trapped itself on the bridge, and that's when Marie gave the signal to open fire.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:56:57.267000+00:00</p>
<p>No doubt they had lined up those shots on the bridge well in advance.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:57:18.471000+00:00</p>
<p>If those failed, the trap would fail.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T06:59:26.257000+00:00</p>
<p>I can only imagine how much the BC Freedom girls were celebrating when they severed both ends of the bridge. At that point, as far as everyone there was concerned, Ooarai was completely screwed.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:00:41.535000+00:00</p>
<p>And once more, Miho was confronted by the possibility of water showing its destructive power.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T07:10:40.677000+00:00</p>
<p>To underestimate the enemy is to gift the victory to him. Miho made the mistake of paying far too much attention to BC Freedom's vice commanders rather than their overall commander, who at that time was more frustrated by the fact that she couldn't eat her cake in peace more than anything else. She didn't realize the lesson she'd taught to the world because as far as she was concerned Ooarai <em>was</em> the world. Miho posses great humility, but it takes a very particular kind of individual to guard against the menace that is <em>Victory Disease.</em> At that time, she seemed to have been mentally preparing for the quarter finals as opposed to the seemingly measly, disorganized opponent at hand. </p>
<p>I actually would have avoided the bridge altogether and ascended the grass knolls instead, with the StuG III F providing sniper overwatch should any BC Freedom give chase, specifically giving instructions to reposition after every two shots. The saving grace for Ooarai was the Mk.IV Landship, were it not for its presence, they would have been finished on that bridge. One thing's for sure, Miho <em>did not</em> feel like going for a swim that day.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:11:40.432000+00:00</p>
<p>They should probably have found an alternate route, yes.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:12:47.143000+00:00</p>
<p>I do question how Miho got the height of the bridge as well as the fact that it broke at a point just above the water's edge. But that's another matter.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:14:04.399000+00:00</p>
<p>Through some sheer plot armor and probably inexperience, BC Freedom's gunnery was horrible after they took out the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T07:15:15.762000+00:00</p>
<p>I would say it's a combination of inexperience and overall shock at the fact that they managed to actually lure <em>the</em> Ooarai Girl's Academy into a trap.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:15:33.893000+00:00</p>
<p>It got them careless, much like Miho's success did for her.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T07:16:45.974000+00:00</p>
<p>I always just chocked this up to Miho finally being pulled into the match 110%, and her innate senses and intuition playing a part in it. Probably something to do with adrenaline as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:20:16.706000+00:00</p>
<p>All the while, the Ooarai recon tanks had been locked in firefights with lone BC Freedom tanks. So when the battle moved to a shootout along the riverbank, possibly the best decision Miho made there was to peel the recon tanks off and bring them in for support.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:22:28.627000+00:00</p>
<p>In fights like this, BC Freedom would still have had something of an advantage, given that the ARL-44 is well-protected despite its many weaknesses and that the Somua is not bad at all for what it is. But against a more experienced school, an open slugfest might not have gone as well for them.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:24:02.700000+00:00</p>
<p>BC Freedom relied on some very good planning. But when their inability to destroy Turtle Team before Miho called Shark Team into action sank things, it was pretty obvious that they had no plan B. So they pulled the most French tactic of all time: cut your losses. Retreat. Retreat is not defeat.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:25:28.202000+00:00</p>
<p>As is the case for many matches in GuP, the battle can be divided into two distinct phases.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:25:57.515000+00:00</p>
<p>The bridge and everything leading up to it is one. The bocage is the other.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:27:34.466000+00:00</p>
<p>It appears that the two team formations were on something of a collision course at the start of Das Finale Part 2, based on the positions of Rabbit and Shark Teams.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T07:28:21.179000+00:00</p>
<p>BC Freedom's lack of a reliable contingency plan should the trap fail was one of the glaring flaws of their whole effort.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-29T07:31:38.460000+00:00</p>
<p>Ooarai actually managed to pull a reversal when Miho noticed that Marie had utilized the 23rd Strategy of War, "Weave a Seamless Blend of Fact and Fiction," when she decided to disrupt BC Freedom's ranks through subterfuge.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:33:05.085000+00:00</p>
<p>It played off of the fact that Marie's new team had not had time to fully congeal.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:33:41.380000+00:00</p>
<p>There was a great deal of show that went into Ooarai entering the bocage.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:34:28.116000+00:00</p>
<p>They had to create an attack that would distract the BC Freedom girls and so screen Mallard Team from being spotted too soon.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:34:55.031000+00:00</p>
<p>Andou: "They rushed in here without thinking!"
As a matter of fact, they were thinking.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:36:42.181000+00:00</p>
<p>Once Ooarai had tied down the BC Freedom force and forced their chain of command to activate, they were then able to pull their tactics.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:36:59.518000+00:00</p>
<p>Mallard Team did quite well at first, firing at just the right moments.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:37:28.037000+00:00</p>
<p>But when Marie stepped in, I think she realized what was going on.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:37:40.927000+00:00</p>
<p>It would be quick to just tell them what was going on.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:38:18.509000+00:00</p>
<p>But it would be far more effective to create the impression that they realized it themselves, which would reunite the team just like the taiyaki stunt did.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:38:51.328000+00:00</p>
<p>By that point, though, it was too late. The team had been whittled down to a state where they were outnumbered.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-29T07:39:30.824000+00:00</p>
<p>It became a fight for survival where Ooarai was trying every possible attack, just slowly hammering BC Freedom down into nothing.</p>

<p>The mistake that Marie made was her hands-off method of dealing with the bocage battle. By trying to make her team run itself without her help, maybe in an effort to show them how well they could work together after the failure at the bridge, she opened up its greatest weakness.</p>

<p>This is the key. Marie had multiple opportunities to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, but it was her attempt at <em>creating</em> that congeniality on the spot between the two subcommanders that ironically created the rift that would burst open into a corridor.</p>

<p>Yes, certainly. Goodnight Crabby, sleep warm 🛌</p>

<p>Perhaps the best plan in battle is to react to the enemy's plan</p>

<p>If you can determine what that plan is, and then set up to counter that, you have an advantage.</p>

<p>That reminds me of something I read in the Art of War: </p>
<p>"Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength."</p>

<p>Aside from Marie’s capabilities as a strategist and commander, I’m most intrigued by her gifts for oratory and public address. She appeals to both sides, and even to those that despise her.</p>

<p>As snooty as she might seem based on her habits (which far outstrip any other Escalator student's for sheer indulgence), she has a talent for treating people like equals. This way she builds rapport with everyone, and this allows her to be that one person that everyone trusts. When she removes herself from the equation, the problem is that they don't trust each other even though they trust her.</p>
<p>I think she's probably one of the few Escalator students not hated by the Examination students, simply because she treats them all like human beings.</p>

<p>The other Escalator students would do well to follow her example. Oshida and Andou could very well bridge the gap between the two factions and help to unite both teams.</p>

<p>But until the warring bitches realize they've been in love with each other from the beginning, Marie is going to have sit in and bridge the gap between them</p>
