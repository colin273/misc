<p>You look over to see a beautiful girl sitting there in a peach colored cardigan, horn rimmed glasses, and worn out Chucks. You notice you were still whistling. </p>

<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-16T04:59:38.737000+00:00</p>
<p>I've actually pondered such topic quite a bit before</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-16T04:59:46.585000+00:00</p>
<p>and I still have no clue</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-16T04:59:58.211000+00:00</p>
<p>That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre here, my friend.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-16T05:00:37.241000+00:00</p>
<p>I think it ultimately depends on the action itself</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T05:00:40.497000+00:00</p>
<p>I would argue that the first one is false. Even if you have a good intention it is possible that you ignored a few factors and in doing so there is something morally wrong about it. This requires a look at the action itself.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T05:01:03.582000+00:00</p>
<p>With a bad intention‚Ä¶well, in that case, I'd argue that that one is false too.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-16T05:01:41.613000+00:00</p>
<p>like, if you murder someone who happens to be a murderer. You have good intentions by murdering a murderer, but that doesn't necessarily put you in the moral right</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T05:01:56.356000+00:00</p>
<p>It's entirely possible that something done with the intent of destroying or causing harm might completely go sideways into the right thing.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-16T05:02:09.064000+00:00</p>
<p>but the intent is still malicious</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T05:02:20.089000+00:00</p>
<p>Once more, the action itself.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T05:02:29.999000+00:00</p>
<p>The intent is malicious, yes.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T05:02:48.626000+00:00</p>
<p>The right thing, for the wrong reasons.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T05:03:34.008000+00:00</p>
<p>In questions like these, I look at the wording, and it specifies the action.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T05:03:40.538000+00:00</p>
<p>So that's where I derive my assessment from.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-16T05:04:07.152000+00:00</p>
<p>To get back to the original question, I think the first sentence is most likely false</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-16T05:04:25.746000+00:00</p>
<p>but the second one depends</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T05:05:28.432000+00:00</p>
<p>Once you get into absolutes, the statements break down when hit with exceptions.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-16T05:05:55.046000+00:00</p>
<p>I think it ultimately just boils down to the action. Even if the intent in someones mind is malicious or not, the action is what will ultimately end up being done, and will affect others</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-16T05:08:06.246000+00:00</p>
<p>These are all valid points, and I agree with much of them, however it requires further inquisition, if you were to set out to commit something that many would consider to be morally wrong, then the outcome of the events happens to benefit many people, is it still morally wrong?</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-16T05:08:40.713000+00:00</p>
<p>I'd say no</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-16T05:09:06.319000+00:00</p>
<p>Ah, an interesting response.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T05:09:15.973000+00:00</p>
<p>I'd say it depends on how closely you scrutinize it. The results are not morally wrong. But does the end justify the means?</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-16T05:10:01.678000+00:00</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>does the end justify the means?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is actually an excellent extension of the initial question. I believe that it does.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-16T05:10:03.357000+00:00</p>
<p>that could apply the opposite way as well. If you do something with good intent, but it ends up being morally questionable, does that make it moral in the end?</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-16T05:10:35.741000+00:00</p>
<p>And then I would say no, it does not.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-16T05:10:53.332000+00:00</p>
<p>I would agree with that</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T05:12:20.351000+00:00</p>
<p>In this case it's a question of "do the <em>means</em> justify the <em>end?"</em></p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-16T05:12:42.615000+00:00</p>
<p>I have a peculiar fascination with the origins of things, and oftentimes I prefer to diagnose and rectify the <em>source</em> of an issue, rather than the individual symptoms, but I must make an exception here. </p>
<p>If the intention was morally right, yet the outcome was morally wrong, then through wholistic scrutiny it remains the latter rather than the former.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T05:13:00.763000+00:00</p>

<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-16T05:15:34.279000+00:00</p>
<p>That doesn't make them moral.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-16T05:19:26.979000+00:00</p>
<p>I think that this is where we enter the realm of discussing the dichotomy of moral relativism and moral objectivity. </p>
<p>I think that while yes, the civilian casualties are a tragedy, in a war there is bound to be casualties of every order, and that it is simply impossible to attempt to secure and guard against such losses. </p>
<p>With that being said, I think that we must refer to the quote by Carl von Clausewitz. </p>
<p>‚ÄúWar is the continuation of politics by other means.‚Äù</p>
<p>With that in mind, then we might be able to deliberate upon the nature of the war itself, and why it is being fought. This recapitulates back to the original questions posed. Is the war being fought for justified means, or is it not?</p>

<p>Technically speaking, from a quantum level, nothing matters because we assigned designations and constructs to everything we‚Äôve perceived from the moment humans were able to utilize consciousness to a higher degree than animals.</p>

<p>Therefore, there is some validity to what <@!459835812624859146>  said, in that we have constructed ‚Äúrules to the game‚Äù so to speak, so that we might hope to separate ourselves from our animal counterparts.</p>

<p>I truly believe that human consciousness was an anomaly. A glitch in the program so to speak. Partly because we still have not evolved to a level where we can truly say we are separate from animals, and that our brains have advanced to a significant degree in which we are able to discern the nature of the universe without being hampered by our biological and evolutionarily predisposed impulses.</p>

<p>I would argue that human intelligence is simply another iteration of intelligence. As humans evolve, we get weaker physically. We would die out if we weren't getting smarter at the same time. We are only able to comprehend our own existence because our minds have extra room for that, whereas outside of human society animals must allocate their mental capacity for survival.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T05:37:51.061000+00:00</p>
<p>We as humans have thought of some very creative ways to keep going, like society. Consciousness must then be a component of coming up with creative ways to keep the human race alive.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T05:38:34.391000+00:00</p>

<p>I agree to some extent that a high functioning intelligence was needed in order to survive with the frail bodies humans possessed in relation to other species. Yet, why did it continue to evolve? Do we really need societies? </p>
<p>It has been proven before that if society should fall, or if mass hysteria were to overtake the population, we would be no better than Neanderthals running around acting on impulse. </p>
<p>Our ability to construct skyscrapers, locomotive, and computers would be rendered null and void should we be thrust into a situation that stresses our cognitive functions to a capacity in which they are not accustomed to. In fact as a species I can confidently say we have <em>regressed,</em> in cognitive capacity.</p>

<p>Humans do not have very many natural advantages over other creatures. Our abilities to survive on our own in the wild are slim at best, even compared to apes, which have all sorts of natural adaptations that we don't have. We have the gift of being able to run far, and a lot of fascia to help us with twisting-type maneuvers--but neither of these are our specialties. What we have as our secret weapon is a brain, and with that we can offset other disadvantages.</p>

<p>Yes, we have the ability to devise all sorts of very creative, very powerful ways to ensure our own survival.

<p>Humans will push AI to the point in which we‚Äôve seen it depicted. The machine will decide that humans are incapable of governing themselves and will enact harsh authoritarian policies in an attempt to rein in human nature.</p>

<p>This brings up something I found a little while back called "Roko's Basilisk."</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-16T06:18:20.998000+00:00</p>
<p>I am intrigued.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T06:20:01.901000+00:00</p>
<p>The idea behind it is that at some point in the future we create AI that is so powerful as to be able to simulate all of time right down to the particle. It knows everything you've ever thought, everything you've ever done, everything that has ever happened in history--it is all-knowing.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T06:20:09.451000+00:00</p>
<p>And this AI has a sinister side to it too.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T06:20:29.944000+00:00</p>
<p>It knows if you thought about it before it existed.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T06:21:12.898000+00:00</p>
<p>If you decided to help bring it into existence by sharing the thought of it or directly contributing to its construction, you're golden. If you never even considered the possibility, you're fine.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T06:22:24.886000+00:00</p>
<p>But if you knew about it and did nothing‚Ä¶well, in that case, you can expect to remain in the worst possible agonizing pain for all eternity, I believe as a simulation of your consciousness.</p>

<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T06:24:16.308000+00:00</p>
<p>In all other respects, from what I understand, it is highly effective at running human society.</p>

<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T06:28:06.428000+00:00</p>
<p>All it needs is to be able to blackmail you from the future into ensuring its existence, playing off human nature.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T06:28:48.421000+00:00</p>
<p>In this way, it rules by fear--which is exactly what a dystopia (or a utopia's true form) relies on.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-16T06:30:57.797000+00:00</p>
<p>With that being said, I have to call into question human civilization, and whether or not the current state of its existence is but a stopgap solution to an inevitable doom.</p>

<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T06:31:42.496000+00:00</p>
<p>At some point we will eventually be forced out of existence. That's the course of evolution.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T06:32:30.993000+00:00</p>
<p>But the most successful evolutionary lines are the ones that are good at surviving for as long as possible.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-16T06:32:35.677000+00:00</p>
<p>Yes, it is, I agree, however it seems that by humanity‚Äôs own hubris, we are attempting to seal our species‚Äô own immortality by unnatural methods.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T06:34:58.063000+00:00</p>
<p>One could also argue that what humanity is doing is perfectly natural, seeing as we do it for the same primal reasons as everything else that's been done, but particularly destructive as we fight to secure our own survival.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T06:35:26.943000+00:00</p>
<p>Which brings me back to Roko's Basilisk for a moment.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T06:35:54.135000+00:00</p>
<p>Not the nature of its blackmail, but the fact that it can simulate every movement of every particle ever.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-16T06:36:28.894000+00:00</p>
<p>Essentially, what humanity has done is created God.</p>

<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T06:38:00.907000+00:00</p>
<p>But it makes me wonder: to what extent was everything we've done, me thinking about this, me typing this out, all inevitable?</p>
<hr />

<p>Yes, precisely.</p>

<p>Do you ever find as well, that you never remember how you got to be where you are in the dream? That you were simply there. You don‚Äôt remember waking up, showering, doing your hair, drinking coffee, getting dressed, and actually traveling to that location.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T06:48:24.636000+00:00</p>
<p>Every dream I remember has that effect. And I think part of why I remember it has to do with the sense of confusion upon waking up and processing it.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T06:49:37.940000+00:00</p>
<p>Goes to show how our sense of time is nothing more than a way for the conscious mind to keep track of things. It's hugely beneficial to our survival, because without a sense of time there would be no such thing as timing, which is also key.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-16T06:52:04.224000+00:00</p>
<p>Yes, we need metrics and indicators for time, such as minutes and seconds. However, when our conscious mind is laid to rest, and the subconscious is allowed to roam our cognitive plains, we lose any sense of order and organization that we had when we were awake, and our deepest desires and hidden memories begin to flood our unconscious mind as the subconscious manifests them into what can only be described as scenes in a film you are both acting in and directing.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T06:55:47.435000+00:00</p>
<p>This can be illustrated just by writing fiction. The pacing of the story is something the author gets to decide. There is a sense of time that can be communicated with events, but at the end of the day everything happening in the story could theoretically take all of eternity to happen, or just a few milliseconds, or however long we want. It all happens. We can jump into a scene partway through, or go at it from start to finish, depending on what we want to achieve.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-16T06:58:36.866000+00:00</p>
<p>It‚Äôs actually rather eerie to ponder that you‚Äôre at the mercy of subconscious mind while you‚Äôre asleep.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T07:02:37.213000+00:00</p>
<p>When you are asleep, all facilities you have to execute your survival instincts disengage so that other natural functions can take place. So the conscious mind shuts down--well, most of it. What's left goes to processing what happened and (hopefully) enhancing your ability to keep surviving. At least I think that's how it's naturally supposed to work.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-16T07:04:32.382000+00:00</p>
<p>Yes, <em>ideally</em>, that‚Äôs how it should work, but it doesn‚Äôt always behave this way. I‚Äôll have to find a PDF, but I think that everyone should read Sigmund Freud‚Äôs ‚ÄúDream Psychology,‚Äù as it helps in explaining what dreams actually signify.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-16T07:05:11.403000+00:00</p>
<p>I tend to think that our dreams are manifestations of whatever it may be that we‚Äôve been actively suppressing in our conscious mind.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-16T07:06:58.139000+00:00</p>
<p>One could argue that dreams are part of how we adapt to our situation. If we don't process what's happened, there's no way we'll be able to put it to good use.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-16T07:11:24.844000+00:00</p>
<p>That‚Äôs true as well, perhaps it is a way for our minds to force us into assessing a situation we‚Äôve been suppressing for whatever reason.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs absolutely true. It‚Äôs lost on most since they are occupied with other distractions and playing the ‚Äúgame‚Äù to be able to draw an meaningful conclusion on why they‚Äôre so miserable all of the time.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T04:46:25.661000+00:00</p>
<p>Indeed. People don't oftentimes think outside the box when it comes to their suffering or misery</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-19T04:48:29.140000+00:00</p>
<p>The problem also stems from how much escapism has been running rampant in society. Feel miserable? Netflix. Unhappy? Instagram. Lonely? Tinder. </p>

<p>I think they‚Äôre also subconsciously afraid of what they might find. Sitting alone and pondering your thoughts is seldom peaceful and can be unsettling. Sometimes you don‚Äôt like what you find.</p>

<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-19T04:53:30.373000+00:00</p>
<p>Some of it may be regret. Seeing that you‚Äôve progressed so far in your life by the hand of others around you. You‚Äôve been living a life inauthentic. Maybe you don‚Äôt like where you‚Äôre going but your hand‚Äôs not on the wheel and you‚Äôre simply along for the ride in your own story.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T04:54:38.455000+00:00</p>
<p>They don't want to dwell or even embrace those thoughts, so they preoccupy their time with other things, like social media and mainstream entertainment</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-19T04:56:57.163000+00:00</p>
<p>It‚Äôs also why mainstream entertainment has been tailor made for the lowest common denominator with very little intellectual elements. They know that people watch these films to escape from their dejected existence so they make the loudest and gaudiest productions. It‚Äôs much the same with music and video games.</p>

<p>Television is just so bland nowadays. Literally everybody is cancelling their cable subscriptions and such</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-19T05:07:53.643000+00:00</p>
<p>Even Netflix is just pumping out garbage now.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:08:15.715000+00:00</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:08:26.007000+00:00</p>
<p>Literally the only draw to Netflix for me is <em>The Crown</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:08:44.403000+00:00</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt even remember the last time I‚Äôve watched TV</p>
<hr />
<p>Kopf#6274 at 2020-11-19T05:08:45.828000+00:00</p>
<p>netflix was always pumping out garbage</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-19T05:09:38.066000+00:00</p>
<p>I watch TV for the Food Network and that‚Äôs it lmao.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:10:53.968000+00:00</p>
<p>A lot of the time that I spend on Reddit and Discord is time that I used to spend watching TV</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:11:15.167000+00:00</p>
<p>Usually, we've adopted a show to watch and then worked through it steadily</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:11:19.961000+00:00</p>
<p>And it was always a good show</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:11:32.120000+00:00</p>
<p>So we could escape from the fact that TV sucks now</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:11:39.886000+00:00</p>
<p>But now, we don't have a show to go through</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:11:47.487000+00:00</p>
<p>The last one we watched was <em>House</em></p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:11:57.038000+00:00</p>
<p>Now there's nothing drawing me to the TV</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:12:16.015000+00:00</p>
<p>The only thing that we ever see on TV anymore is politics</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:12:23.764000+00:00</p>
<p>And I'm sick and tired of hearing about politics day in day out</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:12:36.533000+00:00</p>
<p>So I go into the little room that has become a sort of office for me and Crabby</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:12:47.572000+00:00</p>
<p>And get on the Internet</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:12:55.151000+00:00</p>
<p>Problem solved, I'm happy as a clam again</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-19T05:19:24.403000+00:00</p>
<p>That‚Äôs great that you and Crabby have that space. It‚Äôs nice to have a reprieve from the world. I agree that everything on TV now is unnecessarily politicized and it makes it difficult to watch anything with family members since it always devolves into verbal warfare.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:19:47.160000+00:00</p>
<p>My family agrees on everything politically though</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:19:53.984000+00:00</p>
<p>But the content is all so incendiary</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-19T05:21:00.989000+00:00</p>
<p>Oh I meant in general lol. But yeah, the actual content is all so inflammatory.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:21:35.424000+00:00</p>
<p>If only this room had better climate control though, I'm freezing my ass off</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:21:50.280000+00:00</p>
<p>I can only assume people don‚Äôt come home from a shitty 9-5 job wanting to get lectured about politics all night</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:23:02.679000+00:00</p>
<p>Late-night shows are especially problematic when it comes to stale content and overly-politicized bullshit</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:24:23.732000+00:00</p>
<p>Yeah, it's the late night shows in particular that I try to get away frome</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:24:59.319000+00:00</p>
<p>We don't watch the news during the day, because I don't know of one "news" channel that isn't biased crap</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-19T05:25:22.285000+00:00</p>
<p>The fucking late night shows are the worst offenders along with award shows. Can‚Äôt watch that shit without being bombarded ceaselessly by political pandering.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:25:35.669000+00:00</p>
<p>Most news channels have some kind of political bias nowadays anyway</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-19T05:26:01.951000+00:00</p>
<p>The news, Fox and CNN especially, are just propaganda networks for both sides of the political spectrum.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:26:33.745000+00:00</p>
<p>Fox's news portion shifted waaaaaay left all of a sudden</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:26:46.744000+00:00</p>
<p>They've kept the right-wing talk show hosts for now</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:26:47.100000+00:00</p>
<p>I‚Äôd go as far to say that late night shows have contributed to how overly political everything seems to be today</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:26:50.652000+00:00</p>
<p>Yeah</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:26:54.497000+00:00</p>
<p>It's literally all about the ratings</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:27:05.921000+00:00</p>
<p>I just want the facts</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:27:09.720000+00:00</p>
<p>I don't want to be told what to think</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:27:15.867000+00:00</p>
<p>I don't want to be fed bias</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:27:38.428000+00:00</p>
<p>I don't want to be fed warnings about "you shouldn't read or hear this, it's not true"</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:27:49.239000+00:00</p>
<p>I don't want to hear outlandish statements</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:28:07.956000+00:00</p>
<p>I just want the cold, hard facts. What precisely happened on this day at this time, and who was there.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:28:18.336000+00:00</p>
<p>I used to be somewhat interested and passionate about politics. But in recent years, I‚Äôve come to just hate it all.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:28:49.001000+00:00</p>
<p>This isn't to say I'm not passionate about politics, but I just hate thinking about it because I get riled up really easily</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:28:49.132000+00:00</p>
<p>Mostly news network bullshit and late night shoe bullshit turned me away</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:29:24.026000+00:00</p>
<p>That as well. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I literally just reserve my political beliefs entirely</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:29:43.267000+00:00</p>
<p>I just don‚Äôt want to get pissed off in an argument or something</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:30:12.322000+00:00</p>
<p>I've gotten into political arguments before, they're literally pointless</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:30:24.198000+00:00</p>
<p>Exactly</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:30:31.719000+00:00</p>
<p>All they do is get me angry without convincing anyone to agree with me</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:31:02.298000+00:00</p>
<p>Nobody‚Äôs opinions are being changed. It‚Äôs no more productive than a shouting match</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:32:13.973000+00:00</p>
<p>And when I see people talking politics, and spouting opinions contrary to my own, I instinctively say to myself, "see that guy there? He's a fucking retard because he believes [this or that thing]." I would rather not have known that said person has those beliefs, because now I'm automatically inclined to dislike him.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:32:41.247000+00:00</p>
<p>It's happened with a lot of people with whom I get along well otherwise</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:32:52.551000+00:00</p>
<p>I hear their political opinions and immediately wish I hadn't</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:33:52.646000+00:00</p>
<p>I generally try to not let someone‚Äôs political opinions affect how I see them, if they make it apparent. But if they hyper focus on it too much, I get somewhat inclined to be more skeptical of that person</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:35:44.853000+00:00</p>
<p>Some people, I can put it aside. Others, not so much, especially if they're the kind who write long rants or whine incessantly when politics are brought up.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:35:57.332000+00:00</p>
<p>(The same people who then cry "no politics, no politics")</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:36:34.592000+00:00</p>
<p>Yeah‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs also a bit of a turnoff when someone‚Äôs political stance defines their personality</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:36:52.836000+00:00</p>
<p>Yeah, it is a shame when that happens</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:36:57.687000+00:00</p>
<p>Like, it‚Äôs literally apart of who they are</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:37:12.364000+00:00</p>
<p>Yeah, and they make a big deal about it wherever they go</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:37:21.460000+00:00</p>
<p>(people from the fanfic server will know who I mean)</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-19T05:37:36.449000+00:00</p>
<p>When they put something about it in their status, it's over</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:37:44.035000+00:00</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt <strong>hate</strong> people like that, but I tend to just avoid them when possible</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:38:52.252000+00:00</p>
<p>They take politics <strong>WAY</strong> too seriously. And it‚Äôs honestly painful to watch</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-19T05:42:48.544000+00:00</p>
<p>People who make everything about politics are blocking themselves off from enjoying anything because then <em>everything</em> will make them angry. And so they just end up hurting themselves and blaming it on others.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:43:07.589000+00:00</p>
<p>They need something to be angry at</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-19T05:45:31.939000+00:00</p>
<p>And that‚Äôs no way to live.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:45:48.442000+00:00</p>
<p>It‚Äôs like they are mentally incapable of being happy</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:46:09.993000+00:00</p>
<p>Like everything is fucked and everybody sucks</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:46:26.168000+00:00</p>
<p>It‚Äôs just not a healthy mindset</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-19T05:47:33.284000+00:00</p>
<p>It poisons everything</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-19T05:47:59.254000+00:00</p>
<p>Even things that have nothing to do with politics suddenly become a reason to be miserable</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:48:07.247000+00:00</p>
<p>Yep. And nobody seems to care either</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:48:43.690000+00:00</p>
<p>I get that the world is in a strange place. But good lord, try to be happy and content for once</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:48:55.839000+00:00</p>
<p>It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to see the bright side</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-19T05:54:12.523000+00:00</p>
<p>I just imagine someone going through life like that, finding fault in everything and constantly miserable.</p>
<p>At last they die and end up standing before St. Peter, and he asks the simple question: ‚ÄúWhat was your favorite thing in life on Earth?‚Äù</p>
<p>The unhappy soul replies, ‚ÄúNothing. Life sucked.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù St. Peter inquires. ‚ÄúYou had a roof over your head, you were never starving, you had friends, you had family. Was there really no joy in any of that?‚Äù</p>
<p>The person studies his shoes in embarrassment. ‚ÄúI never noticed.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWell,‚Äù St. Peter says, ‚ÄúI really don‚Äôt know what to do here for once. Because it seems you managed to create your own hell on Earth.‚Äù</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:54:51.714000+00:00</p>
<p>holy shit</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:55:00.290000+00:00</p>
<p>That‚Äôs way too true</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-19T05:56:02.294000+00:00</p>
<p>People just don‚Äôt understand that they need to learn to be happy in life, and not just be contrarian and angry at everything and everyone</p>

<p>‚ÄúTo find everything profound - that is an inconvenient trait. It makes one strain one‚Äôs eyes all the time, and in the end one finds more than one might have wished.‚Äù </p>
<p>Our weekend question:</p>
<p>Is ignorance truly bliss?</p>

<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-20T23:34:57.236000+00:00</p>
<p>Only if you also lack the will to learn imo</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-20T23:35:11.222000+00:00</p>
<p>Ignorance is by definition the lack of knowledge</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-20T23:35:22.382000+00:00</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not a measure of intelligence</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-20T23:35:46.676000+00:00</p>
<p>If you are intelligent, then you will know that you know little</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-20T23:36:02.755000+00:00</p>

<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-20T23:36:33.764000+00:00</p>
<p>As long as you don‚Äôt know that you don‚Äôt know, it is bliss</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-20T23:36:45.148000+00:00</p>
<p>If you know that you don‚Äôt know, it is torture</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-20T23:36:56.751000+00:00</p>
<p>Wait, that just begs the question</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-20T23:38:49.361000+00:00</p>
<p>Unless you are somehow satisfied with ignorance</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-20T23:39:19.563000+00:00</p>

<p>Those are all good points that you‚Äôve made, and it‚Äôs interesting how you‚Äôve expanded the context of the question. It‚Äôs why I leave the question as vague as I can, so that we can discuss it in whatever framework we‚Äôd like. </p>
<p>I would also like to ask now, is unenlightened ignorance preferable to willful ignorance?</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-20T23:47:02.113000+00:00</p>
<p>Even setting aside the definition of ignorance, and the idea of intelligence, is it preferable to have intimate knowledge about your current predicament or to remain ignorant of it?</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-20T23:53:12.027000+00:00</p>
<p>I could make a case in either direction, so I‚Äôll have to think about this one for a while</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-20T23:53:30.092000+00:00</p>
<p>Take your time</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-20T23:59:40.648000+00:00</p>
<p>Unenlightened ignorance, in my opinion, is preferable to willful ignorance. If you are choosing to not know, you will have that nagging thought in the back of your mind: what is it that you‚Äôre missing? If you‚Äôre unenlightened, you don‚Äôt know that you‚Äôre missing something and so it doesn‚Äôt torture you.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs like building a puzzle but you‚Äôre missing a piece. If you don‚Äôt even know you‚Äôre missing one, you‚Äôre still happy as a clam. But if you finish the puzzle, find that there‚Äôs a missing piece, and choose to just leave the hole without looking for the lost piece, you‚Äôll be haunted by that hole in the puzzle reminding you that you missed something. Willful ignorance, therefore, while it can help you avoid thinking about something for a while, cannot protect you from an eventual realization that unenlightened ignorance would never give you at all.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T00:03:22.716000+00:00</p>
<p>Willful ignorance is a self-destructive behavior in the long run. You try to focus on not knowing and it just saps your ability to think and live.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T00:18:33.009000+00:00</p>
<p>This is a spectacular summation of your deliberation on the matter. I agree that unenlightened ignorance is preferable, as you‚Äôve no knowledge of the situation. </p>
<p>The willfully ignorant torture themselves, but now my question is, are we morally and ethically obliged to inform the unenlightened of their predicament? And are we objectively morally wrong in not doing so?</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T00:19:47.057000+00:00</p>
<p>I would say that it depends.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T00:21:40.250000+00:00</p>
<p>If the matter is one on which the unenlightened have no need for knowledge or it must remain secret for the greater good (like matters of military intelligence that are <em>not</em> spying on the people to find and flush out dissent) then leaving the unenlightened in the dark might be worth something.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T00:22:22.244000+00:00</p>
<p>If it's a case where not knowing is all well and good but knowing unlocks something of their potential, then by all means, they deserve to know.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T00:23:25.954000+00:00</p>
<p>They say that being a teacher is one of the noblest jobs one can take on because enlightening the ignorant is what a teacher does for a living, such as that living is.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T00:24:05.978000+00:00</p>
<p>They also say that "what you know can't hurt you." But sometimes knowing may be the difference between life and death.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T00:26:32.139000+00:00</p>
<p>By not enlightening those who are ignorant, there are some situations in which it is morally wrong to see a chance to usefully enlighten and ignore it.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T00:26:45.667000+00:00</p>
<p>There are others in which it is the right thing for other reasons.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T00:27:09.982000+00:00</p>
<p>Ignorance is bliss--including when it comes down to knowing just how ignorant people are.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T00:29:10.740000+00:00</p>
<p>This, to be clear, is not an argument to attempt spouting and preaching at every turn. Such behavior is annoying, and often useless because a shotgun approach is not very precise. But in many cases people deserve to know the facts, and they can form their own views of them.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T00:49:10.049000+00:00</p>
<p>I agree with all points made. Especially your closing statement, as I feel as if we live now in an increasingly ultracrepidarianistic society in which it is <em>encouraged</em> to arrogantly patronize others, to which I ask, in the pursuit of selfish and self-interested enlightenment, has this forced the common man into an even deeper ignorance of the state of affairs?</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T00:53:53.372000+00:00</p>
<p>There's a huge difference between telling people what they ought to know and telling them what to think. And these days, the common man doesn't like to think too hard, seeking instant answers, so we turn to other sources to tell us what to think--and when that happens we get our ever-declining state of affairs.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T00:54:55.559000+00:00</p>
<p>So by attempting to push our interpretations on other people, we rob them of the opportunity to understand the world around them.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T00:55:09.941000+00:00</p>
<p>This, I would argue, is far worse than if we never told them anything.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-21T00:56:56.479000+00:00</p>
<p>The common man is utterly ignorant of reality because he is told what to think before he is allowed to see hard truths.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T00:57:13.862000+00:00</p>
<p>And we choose to allow ourselves to be told what to think.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-21T00:57:35.357000+00:00</p>
<p>And so when he sees hard truths, all he can do to process it is what he has been conditioned to do.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T00:58:55.582000+00:00</p>
<p>Forced comprehensive interpretations of the world instead of presenting things as they are with the freedom to interpret them leads to a polarized society--because you either agree with the interpretation shoved down your throat, or you don't. There is no such thing as a middle way, and they say that the truth lies somewhere in the middle.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T01:01:40.057000+00:00</p>
<p>In that case, the truth is dead. The middle of the road has been obliterated by years of meticulous planning by various institutions so that we may arrive at the point we are now. I agree with both of you.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T01:03:34.022000+00:00</p>
<p>However, perhaps we should extend some generosity to the common man, and ask, were it not for the nature of their environment and social zeitgeist, would they not be more inclined to pursue the truth? I believe that the blame should distributed equally, as the man is only as good as the state allows him to be.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T01:08:32.125000+00:00</p>
<p>Polarization is a self-perpetuating thing. Polarize the media, and the media will polarize the people, and the people will in turn lead to the media becoming more polarized, and round and round we go. The media is a conduit for opinions, and I would argue that you see a lot more opinion than fact in the news these days, with both sides picking and choosing what they share. Unless you watch every source somehow, good luck getting a complete picture of the facts without an opinion attached.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T01:09:16.787000+00:00</p>
<p>People tend to look for validation, and that's part of what drives the people to seek out the media as it is--it validates opinions.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-21T01:10:48.449000+00:00</p>
<p>Sounds like willful ignorance to me</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T01:11:16.644000+00:00</p>
<p>When you take a step back, it's disheartening to see that long-trusted sources do absolutely nothing trustworthy anymore. But at the same time, there's an opportunity there--now that you know that your source of information is defective, you can start seeking out the truth with the knowledge that it is on your own terms.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-21T01:12:30.584000+00:00</p>
<p>That‚Äôs a good point. If you know that the institutions don‚Äôt offer the truth, then you won‚Äôt swallow their untruths.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T01:16:00.939000+00:00</p>
<p>The issue with going to loudly warn people of their plight as slaves to what they want to hear is that they will in turn realize--you basically turn yourself into a talking head telling them what to think of the media, probably trying to push your own interpretation. In this sense it's self-defeating. Informational independence is something they have to find themselves--but the majority of people, I fear, are not going to see this as something they need.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T01:16:54.448000+00:00</p>
<p>This is why you can't present a "the sky is falling" way of looking at things.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T01:17:16.233000+00:00</p>
<p>Drama and fear are ways to force interpretations.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T01:18:22.433000+00:00</p>
<p>But if you present it simply as "I'm not going to tell you what to think and I'm happier for it," some people might start to see where you're coming from.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-21T01:18:26.514000+00:00</p>
<p>Reminds me of Emerson‚Äôs essay about being a non-conformist</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-21T01:18:40.883000+00:00</p>
<p>If you just agree with him, then you fail</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T01:18:42.768000+00:00</p>
<p>People seek interpretations of the world, but they seldom seek interpretations of knowledge itself.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T01:19:35.773000+00:00</p>
<p>It seems to me that in the case of Emerson's essay, if you simply agree with him you fail, but if you can arrive at that conclusion by your own way of reason you pass.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T01:20:35.632000+00:00</p>
<p>Because in that sense you are adopting your own way--even if it happens to look like what someone else has already thought of, you arrived at it yourself instead of allowing yourself to be told what to think.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T01:23:07.169000+00:00</p>
<p>Yes, I agree. Objective knowledge remains the same, however arriving at that conclusion independently is a crucial distinctive skill that must be sought after if one is to pursue knowledge in any meaningful capacity.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T01:24:11.372000+00:00</p>
<p>Allow me to read through what you and Fifi have written so that I may address some of the points that were made.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T01:41:20.806000+00:00</p>
<p>Reading through what you both have written reminds of the work by Edward Bernays titled "Propaganda" in which he describes how he wanted to translate his successes as a political advisor and PR manager to things such as cigarettes and soda. </p>
<p>Being the nephew of psychologist Sigmund Freud, he spoke at length with his uncle about human nature and human psychological habits, and came to the conclusion that people seldom think for themselves and can easily be manipulated. After discovering the malleability of the human psyche, he developed what we now refer to as propaganda. The main components consist of manipulating the emotions and subconscious desires. Now how does this apply to our discussion? </p>
<p>We see this placation and manipulation occur on a daily and nightly basis across the country, and its efficacy lays bare the fact that most people's thoughts are not their own, and that their sensemaking has been drastically impaired by their own conformity.</p>

<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T01:49:12.934000+00:00</p>
<p>I think that there is an innate sense of hatred towards the truth in most people. The truth that exists is unsatisfactory, inconvenient, and discomforting, therefore they seek truths that will fit within their framework of understanding and biases. This is but a bastardization of truth.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-21T01:49:55.861000+00:00</p>
<p>~~isn't that the reason why religion exists?~~</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T01:50:41.623000+00:00</p>
<p>One could argue that it is, but being religious and seeking the truth are not necessarily mutually exclusive.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T01:51:19.141000+00:00</p>
<p>Well, what happens when the truth is not in alignment with what the church espouses?</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T01:52:15.234000+00:00</p>
<p>This is where it comes in handy to not be <em>too</em> religious.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T01:52:35.817000+00:00</p>
<p>That is easier said than done, my friend.</p>

<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T01:53:23.736000+00:00</p>
<p>I get the impression that being an active participant in a religion makes it easier to seek the truth than being a passive participant.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T01:53:39.315000+00:00</p>
<p>If you're part of the process of making celebrations happen, you have to understand what's going on.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T01:54:49.958000+00:00</p>
<p>I actually draw the opposite conclusion. The very nature of religion is to placate the living that are plagued by the idea of death. All else in between is fundamentalist gibberish.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-21T01:56:14.699000+00:00</p>
<p>I mean, not everything except the idea of an afterlife is necessarily bad</p>

<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T01:56:39.548000+00:00</p>
<p>I choose to pull out of religion something halfway to what the church teaches.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-21T01:57:01.308000+00:00</p>
<p>religion oftentimes promotes good life habits, like not indulging yourself in harmful activities and being generous</p>
<hr />

<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-21T01:57:29.745000+00:00</p>
<p>that's probably one of the greater benefits of religion in my opinion</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T01:58:02.021000+00:00</p>
<p>It's also a grounding experience, in a way.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T01:58:06.539000+00:00</p>
<p>Yes, but are these not common enough ideas that any rational person would arrive at that conclusion sometime in their own lives, divorce from religion?</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-21T01:59:43.016000+00:00</p>
<p>perhaps if religion weren't so popular throughout history, such virtues wouldn't be as common</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T02:01:27.202000+00:00</p>
<p>I have read religious texts and equate them to institutional versions of Aesop's Fables. There is certainly beautiful poetry and prose to be found, but to take it in any other literal sense would be foolish.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T02:02:44.914000+00:00</p>
<p>Such virtues were conceived by man, meaning that they would have seen dissemination at some point throughout history. Religion simply expedited the process through fear mongering.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:02:48.260000+00:00</p>
<p>I go to church every week, and I've found that everything talked about can be taken in a non-literal sense.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:03:03.403000+00:00</p>
<p>It all depends on how literally you take it.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T02:03:15.783000+00:00</p>

<p>Coming from a standpoint of literary analysis and critical thinking, I get a lot out of being Catholic without actually needing to truly convince myself that there is a God.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T02:05:54.897000+00:00</p>
<p>I myself was raised in and around Catholicism, and as I have mentioned, there is certainly something to be gleaned from the poetry and anecdotes in scripture, but I cannot adhere to the strict doctrine and dogma.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:07:08.073000+00:00</p>
<p>The doctrine is worth nothing if you don't take a look at what it all represents.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:07:31.485000+00:00</p>
<p>If you just take it as rules to live by and a template for your daily life, you get absolutely nothing out of it.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:08:12.300000+00:00</p>
<p>However, if you see where it comes from, even if you don't personally agree with some of it, you can apply the parts of the underlying principles in a way that suits you.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T02:11:02.697000+00:00</p>
<p>I have found that most of the principles I've gleaned from religion were already things I had discovered through other means, and through my deliberations. I'm simply speaking from the perspective of someone who has seen both the beneficial and the destructive qualities of religion firsthand.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T02:14:29.167000+00:00</p>
<p>One might argue that there are other more efficient and effective ways of distributing the virtues and principles of religion without the need for a place where people go to compare clothing.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:20:00.590000+00:00</p>
<p>The issue is that people often need some kind of allegory to understand things. Religion works twofold, with the texts serving as allegories to indirectly teach other things and with gatherings providing a sense of community. In a sense, it's quite efficient at killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:21:21.119000+00:00</p>
<p>The actual power of religion, I find, is actually hinted at in a certain Bible passage:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:
  and after the earthquake a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice.</p>

<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:22:24.452000+00:00</p>
<p>In the middle of all the pomp and circumstance and all that, it's the subtlety that it manages to capture that might be harder for many with limited life experience to appreciate without the vehicle of religion.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T02:23:18.032000+00:00</p>
<p>Perhaps this is more so revelatory of the lack of independent thought of most. I think that I may be thinking too far ahead in terms of the advancement of human civilization and giving people too much credit.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T02:26:44.718000+00:00</p>
<p>I think that in the future, there will no longer be a need for religion and god, but that would require a rationally and logically inclined societal paradigm shift. I do believe that we are living in a godless society, but not out of pursuit of truth, knowledge, and enlightenment, but out of laziness.</p>
<hr />

<p>It seems to me that though the religious beliefs might become obsolete in the future, the texts themselves would not. They still pack a powerful message and important lessons with common threads between them, and if they are looked at in the sense that I look at them--as literature first and foremost, and as part of understanding human nature with the nature of religion--they might actually prove to be more effective down the line than they do now.</p>

<p>Many religions throughout history teach that God or the gods make us in their own image--but really, we make whatever higher power we choose to believe in, in our own image.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:36:17.942000+00:00</p>
<p>And I don't mean that we craft a justification for everything we do.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T02:36:38.093000+00:00</p>
<p>This is exactly it.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:37:18.908000+00:00</p>
<p>If we regard some central figure or set of beliefs as a representation of the truth, then we have to arrive at our own conception of what that is.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:37:24.701000+00:00</p>
<p>That's what it is--a representation.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:39:07.146000+00:00</p>
<p>And there is yet another facet of Christian beliefs that I think can be used to critically examine it: the Book of Revelation.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:40:12.414000+00:00</p>
<p>Supposedly everything in it is an accurate account of what Heaven looks like, a detailed description.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:40:50.434000+00:00</p>
<p>But if you look at everything as a symbol, it starts to make so much more sense.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-21T02:42:02.912000+00:00</p>
<p>Yes, in a literary sense, the book of Revelation has always intrigued me.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:42:18.165000+00:00</p>
<p>Also, there is only one source: John. Notice how it was not "revealed" to anyone else.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:43:05.516000+00:00</p>
<p>This is not a rejection of it--but since we don't know exactly what John saw despite his efforts at describing it, a little imagination is required.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:43:33.224000+00:00</p>
<p>And so different people may picture it in different ways.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:45:15.669000+00:00</p>
<p>So in a sense, it's like the Dragon Scroll from Kung Fu Panda--there is no "final secret" to everything.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:45:23.028000+00:00</p>
<p>It's only what we make it.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:50:52.569000+00:00</p>
<p>The one major flaw of religion that I see is people only zero in on certain components and build everything they do around those. The full meaning is, unsurprisingly, contained within the full package.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:55:16.722000+00:00</p>
<p>And so if we look at the Crusades, I see a major flaw in "Deus lo vult!" Because how the hell would the pope know that God wants a murderous war just for one faction of those who believe in him to seize control of the Holy Land? This only draws from the more pessimistic teachings and ignores the ones that preach a message of hope. Such a pope is not fit to lead--because in making decisions like that he imposes his own will, the will of someone who is prone to making rash decisions and using power because he has it, and like sheep the people go to violate one of the Ten Commandments--"Thou shalt not kill."</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-21T02:58:17.080000+00:00</p>
<p>If applied in a certain way, old religious teachings before the Enlightenment era were probably quite, quite effective, because people learned certain things without realizing them. But when weaponized, it's like nuclear power--a source of great achievement becomes a source of great annihilation.</p>

<p>The topics discussed here are things that I haven't really even thought about until now. And that's where conversations like the one from last night are self-fulfilling--if you've never thought about it, you don't realize you haven't thought about it, but when you do it opens up new avenues of thinking about things.</p>

<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-22T01:03:51.898000+00:00</p>
<p>Which leads to our question:</p>
<p>With technology being an ever centripetal force in modern life, and with the media‚Äôs utilization of technology to control the narrative, will the truth ever be accepted and is truth dead?</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-22T01:07:54.366000+00:00</p>
<p>Accepting truth on a societal level is a lengthy process. So I think it is entirely possible that the truth, whatever that is, will eventually be accepted--but it will ironically take longer than it typically does because people get instant results instead of having to wait for media input and having to use their own heads while they wait.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-22T01:13:19.802000+00:00</p>
<p>It seems that it has become ever increasingly popular to ridicule those who criticize the proliferation of technology by calling them "Boomers," and discarding their criticisms, whether valid or otherwise, as being nothing more than saccharin, overly sentimental nonsense. Do you think that this herd mentality has created a culture of people that claim to be "woke" yet despise the truth and those that seek to bring it to light?</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-22T01:23:20.346000+00:00</p>
<p>Probably. A look at the behavior of ‚Äúwoke‚Äù people on the internet shows something interesting‚Äîthey seldom have much to offer besides ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wrong‚Äù and arguments full of holes against reasoning. They also tend to be very much against anyone who disagrees with them setting foot in their echo chambers. To be woke, I find, is the epitome of conformity.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-22T01:23:35.176000+00:00</p>

<p>This is especially egregious nowadays. I'm reminded of being in high school and seeing how violently political the environment was getting. You had students running around as young as fourteen espousing all of these political ideas in which they had no understanding of. It was staggering, and it made many of us wary to interact with each other since we were unaware of where the other stood on the political spectrum.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-22T01:56:26.051000+00:00</p>
<p>The sheer amount of people who are influenced by political ideas, and get them shoved in their faces in todays society is particularly atrocious. What business to middle-schoolers, high-schoolers, and even college students have in getting involved with politics? Especially regarding politics that they don't even understand in the first place?</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-22T01:57:17.765000+00:00</p>
<p>Young people like that shouldn't be involved with politics. Not only because they don't understand it, but also because it has so little bearing on their lives at that particular point in time.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-22T01:59:37.286000+00:00</p>
<p>That brings up a question that I have had for the past couple years. How the hell did we end up like this? How the fuck did everybody all of a sudden get so politically vocal? And why do we put so much emphasis on it nowadays, even if it ultimately isn't going to affect your personal life?</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-22T02:02:34.530000+00:00</p>
<p>To the Greeks, the city-state (<em>polis</em>) was the most advanced form of community, and <em>politics</em> was the enterprise of achieving the good of the city-state. Now, with that being said, that is a <strong>very</strong> idealized and optimistic view of politics, and since then, we have strayed further and further from that ideal. I agree that young people should not be concerned with the goings on of politics especially in their current state, but I think they should be educated as to <em>what</em> politics is. Less Social Justice, and <em>more</em> Political Science and History.</p>

<p>On Snapchat, in 2016, there were advertisements for which political candidate you should vote for depending on which state you were in.

<p>The coronavirus is real. But the power of a lockdown to stop it is not.

<p>This has been occurring for years but most are incapable of reifying the issue. The key is to maintain the abstraction of the situation, so that people are inclined to believe whatever it is that you say to them, true or otherwise. Take a look at the Patriot Act, passed under the Bush Administration. Its sole purpose is to extract sensitive information from the American public, and allows the government and intelligence agencies carte blanche when monitoring American citizens. It was said by the administration that it would be a temporary antiterrorist counter measure, and that it would be dissolved at a later time. </p>
<p>Spoiler alert, it <em>hasn't.</em> Even the name is deceptive. In calling it the "Patriot Act," anyone opposed to it would be deemed unpatriotic and potentially a threat to national security.

<p>Then people will mention their "rights" and how that will somehow prevent the government from reconnoitering your private life. The same government that gave you those rights will somehow fear that you have them. </p>
<p>Rights are an idea, they're a great idea, but that's about it, and if you read the news even badly, you'll realize that the list of rights you thought you had is getting shorter and shorter and shorter. Governments will fabricate crises in order to justify to the people why they are instating laws and bills that seem to be growing ever more autocratic.</p>

<p>The fundamentals of the US government system is less to do with everything being easy to obtain, or trustworthy, but more so a life without government interference, hence why the US uses a strict capitalist, free-trade, economic policy, the freer the market, the freer the people. The capitalist system is made for the average citizen across, lower class, middle class or upper class, it's not meant to make things easy or perfect, but no system can ever do that. The US has such a complex election system for reasons like this, it provides the least objectional government out of all of them.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-22T13:50:56.564000+00:00</p>
<p><@!419007089873125398> Yes, I agree that ideally this is how things <em>should</em> operate, but is this the reality? I think we can both answer that within the same margins. Remember, America was founded by a group of <em>slave owners</em> who wanted to be <em>free</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>a life without government interference</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet is this not what occurs anyways? </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>the freer the market, the freer the people</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under any other circumstances, I might actually agree with you, but seeing late stage capitalism ravage its way across the country, I will have to argue the contrary. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>lower class, middle class, or upper class</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same lower class that can't afford to buy a box of Cheerios because they might not be able to have enough gas to get Johnny and Debbie to school? The middle class that's begun to compress into a glorified working class, leaving only the upper echelons of the "middle class" with any meaningful disposable income? I'll break it down like this: </p>
<p>The upper class keeps all of the money, pays none of the taxes. The middle class pays all of the taxes, does all of the work. The poor are there to scare the shit out of the middle class. Keep 'em showing up to those "jobs."</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The US has such a complex election system for reasons like this</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why don't you ask Al Gore how he feels about that "complex election system."</p>
<p>"If voting worked, they would make it illegal"</p>
<ul>
<li>Mark Twain</li>
</ul>
<p>Even Benjamin Franklin described democracy as "two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch." </p>
<p>"Dictatorship naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme liberty."</p>
<ul>
<li>Plato</li>
</ul>
<p>The whole idea is to lull people into a false sense of security that the system is working <em>for</em> them when in reality it is quite the opposite. It's undeniable when one sits to deliberate upon the current state of affairs that there is something indubitably wrong with things, and you just can't quite put your finger on it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Frederick the Great#3959 at 2020-11-22T14:04:24.770000+00:00</p>
<p>Obviously the USA is not perfect and has many flaws, but it's system provides a life for the people living in it which is one of complacency and overall happiness. If the people believe they are free, and are happy believing it, then there isn't much that can be done, or even should be done. It's the old debate over which is better; freedom, or happiness. I myself am not American, nor do I wish to be one, but I have to respect and admire the way the US citizen lives his life and how the government runs things. Things such as the US waging decades long two front wars in places like Iraq and Afghanistan without the average US citizen feeling a single thing, is incredible. The fact the the US even has interests in landlocked Asians countries is amazing. America is in a position where it can basically sit back, change almost nothing domestically, and still profit massively from itself, and others. I personally don't believe in pure individualism such as the US, or democracy as a whole for that matter, but I still feel the need to respect both the US government and US citizen.</p>

<p><@!419007089873125398> I am an American citizen, and I can say with confidence that Americans are some of the laziest, incompetent, and ignorant people I have ever met, and yes, I have been outside of the country on numerous occasions. This is a sweeping generalization and does not apply to every single American but the amount of imbeciles running around in this country is staggering. America also has not won a strategic victory militarily since WW2, and every victory since then has been a tactical victory. The fact that the US has had carte blanche in terms of running amok in the Middle East without anyone "feeling a single thing" is more of a problem than a benefit. America takes interest in anywhere it can place its dick. Let's not even discuss the heinous crimes committed by the CIA <em>alone.</em> I also believe that democracy on a large scale is bound to become perverted and meaningless, leading to two doors that lead to the same slaughterhouse.</p>

<p>I think what you‚Äôre describing is an idealized version of what America is. Ideally, yes, America should be free of government interference in life, and everyone should be able to prosper from America‚Äôs enormous international wealth. (Speaking of which, there are plenty of people who hate the way America sticks its nose everywhere. But I digress.) That‚Äôs what the founding fathers envisioned: a free country.</p>
<p>But this is not what we really have.</p>
<p>In practice, all Americans are equal, but some are more equal than others. The nation is largely controlled by powerful people and institutions who climbed the ladder like everyone else, but then pulled the ladder up behind them so that none could follow. Big Tech and the mainstream media are two examples of this. Their attack on American liberty is twofold:</p>
<ol>
<li>Win votes from the common man by claiming to be uplifting the oppressed.</li>
<li>Oppressing the shit out of everyone but themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p>Common Americans have been blindly electing these politicians to office for decades. All the things they claimed they would do to fight for their constituents, they never did. America‚Äôs inner cities are still dumps as a result. Meanwhile, everybody is subjected to the ‚Äúcancel culture‚Äù that suppresses anyone who calls these gangsters out. This is done mainly in the media but also by social media companies. The cancel culture‚Äôs movers and shakers are simply the foot soldiers for the big guys. And now with the coronavirus crisis, where some state governors are enforcing strict and unnecessary measures to keep people home (which just prolongs the pandemic and makes things worse all around), this machine has been kicked into high gear.</p>
<p>America is really not the land of the free, but the land of people who think they are free. A few people have managed to own the rest of the U.S. population. The common man is brainwashed into thinking that it‚Äôs for his own good, just as slavery‚Äôs defenders presented their inhuman practice.</p>

<p>A look at the stratagems of <em>The Art of War</em> suggests that they are centered around keeping the enemy from fighting their hardest, which would probably make sense if you're trying to keep the losses to a minimum. Breaking the enemy's spirit without inflicting needless suffering is what I consider mastery of the battlefield.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-26T02:30:50.552000+00:00</p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. In fact I‚Äôve probably read The Art of War back to front countless times lol. It advocates for maneuver warfare and defeating the enemy with as little resistance as possible, by breaking their resolve, amongst other things.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-26T02:32:15.818000+00:00</p>

<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-26T02:34:40.195000+00:00</p>

<p>The NVA were militarily inferior in every sense of the word - except for General Vo Nguyen Giap's innate understanding of public opinion, world politics, and unconventional warfare. He had the option at the outset of the war to receive shipments of trucks and other various military equipment, but he came to the realization that this would only lead to the NVA becoming an inferior imitation of the United States military. He opted instead to focus on what he had at his disposal and exploit them as strengths. </p>
<p>He noticed that the Americans moved supplies using trucks and helicopters, both of which were noisy and could be identified even at a distance. Realizing this, he chose to utilize the local civilian population and farmers to surreptitiously move supplies and equipment around the the dense rural areas with which the local population was keenly familiar with, and the Americans were <em>not</em>. This freed up manpower for him to not only assault, disrupt, and destroy American supply lines but to use any captured supplies as his own. </p>
<p>After successfully disrupting and defeating American forces using guerrilla tactics and psychological warfare, he directed his attention to the American public, which at the time was relatively unaware of the nature of true nature of the conflict save fo propaganda photos. The Tet Offensive was designed not to defeat the American military, but the American public. He chose to strike in key locations where he knew the Americans were filming and photographing the war, and though one might view the Tet Offensive as a <em>military</em> failure, it more than succeeded in turning the tide of public opinion. </p>
<p>The Americans have fallen into a pit of strategic stagnation since then, and have been under the influence of the McNamara Fallacy to a startling degree.</p>

<p>For one, there was the fact that in Germany there was a shortage of resources, made worse by the fact that those resources were spread out over two fronts.

<p>Which is exactly the idea right now in the Middle East, <em>well other than the installation of puppet governments and bolstering privatized central banks</em>, they're trying to win the war by inflicting losses.

<p>Tactically speaking, the United States Armed Forces has every advantage. Reasonably sound battle tactics, well-trained troops, state-of-the-art weaponry, all that. But a fighting force is only as good as everyone in it, and that includes the leadership deciding strategy. So while the US military wins in most individual engagements, the whole thing ends up being a mess. If there were good tactics combined with excellent strategy, the war might be going differently.</p>
<p>But of course, if the kinds of thinking that would go into a strategy to win here had been implemented from the start, I doubt we would even be fighting this war.</p>

<p>One of the first things the United States does when it invades countries in the name of "freedom" in this century was to enslave the population with <em>debt</em> via central banks owned by global banking cartels that are integrated into the global financial system. For example, in 2001 the US invaded Afghanistan and within two years the Afghanistan Bank was established by Presidential Decree. The President who gave the decree was Hamad Karzai. The man with ties to UNOCAL, and the man who was installed <em>by</em> the US a couple months after the invasion. </p>
<p>In 2003 just a few months after the invasion of Iraq, the US didn't even wait for the cover of a puppet government and created the Central Bank of Iraq to, in their words, "Bring Iraqis legal framework for banking in line with international standards," or in laymen's terms, or if they had an honesty filter, "The US, as an occupying power, foisted upon the people of Iraq a privately controlled central bank which then began to issue <em>debt</em>." This makes you wonder why Libyan leader Momar Qaddafi was destroyed as he was attempting to implement a gold-backed currency that would have been <em>outside</em> the purview of the central banking system and would have challenged the petrodollar. </p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen a government is dependent upon bankers for money, they and not the leaders of the government control the situation, since the hand that gives is above the hand that takes. Money has no motherland; financiers are without patriotism and without decency; their sole object is gain.‚Äù

<p>It's funny you mention empires, Fifi. The US has been empire-building but has not realized that the age of empires has long since passed. I find it ironic and wildly amusing that prior to WW1 and WW2 respectively, the US was largely isolationist and preferred to allow Europe to settle its issues and quandaries without their involvement. Of course this all changed when they were infused with newfound big dick energy after defeating Germany and look how far that's gotten them.</p>

<p>From a cultural and economic standpoint, it makes sense for the US to get involved with European affairs. After all, the US was founded by Europeans and maintains close ties to Europe. But it makes no sense to keep meddling in the Middle East when the only thing that ties us to that region fo the world is oil. Let the oil guys do their thing; we have other ways of getting energy that don't rely on the Middle East.</p>

It‚Äôs never going to get any better. Don‚Äôt look for it. Be happy with what you got. Because the <strong>owners</strong> of this country don‚Äôt want that. I‚Äôm talking about the real owners now. The <em>real</em> owners. The big, wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions. Forget the politicians‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre irrelevant. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don‚Äôt. You have no choice. You have <strong>owners</strong>. <strong>They own you</strong>. They own <em>EVERYTHING</em>! They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They‚Äôve long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, and city halls. They got the judges in their back pocket. And they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear!</p>
<p>THEY‚ÄôVE GOT YOU BY THE BALLS! They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else. But I‚Äôll tell you what they don‚Äôt want. They don‚Äôt want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don‚Äôt want well-informed. Well educated people capable of critical thinking. They‚Äôre not interested in that. That doesn‚Äôt help them. That‚Äôs against their interest. That‚Äôs right. They don‚Äôt want people who are smart enough to sit around the kitchen table and figure out how badly they‚Äôre getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don‚Äôt want that.‚Äù</p>

<p>By refraining from any overt sexual activity with Mika, he shows a fondness for traditionalism and morality.</p>
<hr />

<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-27T03:52:55.609000+00:00</p>
<p>but then again, is every form of sexual activity necessarily immoral?</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-27T03:54:30.413000+00:00</p>
<p>It depends upon the intent. Rape is immoral.</p>

<p>Well at the same time, someone might argue that much of what we deem "immoral" is simply because that is what our sociological system and structure has foisted upon us.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-27T03:58:37.351000+00:00</p>
<p>Our perceptions of the world are all constructs, much like time.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-27T03:58:46.551000+00:00</p>
<p>that's pretty difficult to articulate actually</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-27T03:59:44.293000+00:00</p>
<p>it's hard to imagine something that we see as extremely immoral being actually morally neutral</p>

<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-27T04:03:14.728000+00:00</p>
<p>Precisely. Much of, if not all, of the social convents that have permeated the fabric of daily life for human beings were created by human beings and thus will die with us when our race inevitably goes extinct. It doesn't matter that Johnny stole a cookie from the cookie jar because the universe doesn't know what the concept of stealing is nor what a cookie jar is.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-27T04:04:13.472000+00:00</p>
<p>same goes for any other race. Any and all social systems they may have will also die with their species when they get wiped out</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-27T04:04:53.583000+00:00</p>
<p>Precisely. Moral determinism is only useful when there's a species to base it upon. Otherwise, the universe simply looks down and laughs.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-27T04:05:32.593000+00:00</p>
<p>or just doesn't respond at all</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-27T04:06:32.790000+00:00</p>
<p>Exactly. This notion that the universe is somehow responsive to our claims upon it is nothing but the shortsighted hubris that has become so prominent in humankind.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-27T04:07:20.403000+00:00</p>
<p>the universe is quite literally under no obligation to make sense to us, and it has no obligation to be responsive to any of our perceptions or social structures</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-27T04:07:42.346000+00:00</p>
<p>Scientifically speaking, we <em>are</em> the universe and the universe is us, therefore it is foolish to think we could have any meaningful effect on the universe because the act of simply saying this makes the statement redundant by its very nature.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-27T04:08:55.918000+00:00</p>
<p>if you really think about it, us discovering stuff about the universe is just a massive journey of introspection</p>
<hr />

<p>The most difficult aspect to this is trying to maintain some semblance of objectivity whilst scrutinizing the universe, trying to avoid ascribing any of our human social conventions to it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-27T04:15:12.534000+00:00</p>
<p>I'd say that's one of the biggest flaws of humanity in general. We have an incredibly difficult time seeking objectivity above our social constructs and ideas.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-27T04:17:35.011000+00:00</p>
<p>The issue is that we've internalized, personified, and attached ourselves too closely to our constructs. Like you said, this is a flaw with humans in general, we take things far too personally and drink our own Kool-Aid whenever we get the chance. You criticize someone's favorite video game or football team and they take it as if you've insulted them personally.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-27T04:18:33.083000+00:00</p>
<p>It's a shame honestly. If we had stuck to more objective thinking since our species has arrived, we'd probably be far more advanced as a civilization</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-27T04:21:27.875000+00:00</p>
<p>Oh without a doubt. I can't see any sort of benefit from this behavior from a purely Darwinian, biological survivalist aspect. If anything, this makes us more prone to damn near wiping each other out when ideas, religion, or interests conflict on a worldwide scale. Even narrowing it down to a tribal perspective, this only leads to casualties amongst your own men when you go to war with another tribe, casualties that must be replenished through the next generation of men.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-27T04:24:58.854000+00:00</p>
<p>it's all just really counterproductive to our progression as a species. Needlessly killing each other and exploiting each other over greed, faith, or whatever, is literally doing nothing to help our civilization</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-27T04:29:42.410000+00:00</p>
<p>The problem is that self interest is practically hardwired into humans, and therefore we actually delude ourselves into thinking that needlessly killing each other and exploiting each other <strong>is</strong> in fact furthering civilization.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-27T04:30:52.050000+00:00</p>
<p>I guess it's just a byproduct of our primitive nature. We can't really get rid of it in any reasonable manner‚Ä¶</p>

<p>The self-interested mentality, I think, comes from the fact that evolution is inherently competitive.</p>

<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-27T04:32:50.455000+00:00</p>
<p>It's hard-wired into our brains.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-27T04:33:27.949000+00:00</p>
<p>But society has moved at a pace far exceeding that of evolution.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-27T04:33:55.592000+00:00</p>
<p>So in the process of trying to reduce the harmful effects of the competitive mentality, it merely changes form.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-27T04:36:00.946000+00:00</p>
<p>Our own technological, sociological, and civilizational advancement has been to the detriment of those at the helm of such evolutions.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-27T04:36:03.908000+00:00</p>
<p>The reasons for us to kill each other change--that is, we seek out new reasons. And whereas it used to be a matter of survival, the increasing complexity of our existence means that there are more things that we see as viable reasons to attack each other.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-27T04:36:41.357000+00:00</p>
<p>We pretty much got better at justifying why we should kill each other.</p>

<p>The issue with the "return to monke" meme is that we had to have gotten our tendencies from somewhere.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-27T04:38:06.356000+00:00</p>

<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-27T04:39:28.881000+00:00</p>
<p>I won't lie, I actually had to look up the return to monke meme, but I find it fascinating that such a notion even exists and that it's found an audience.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-27T04:40:10.149000+00:00</p>
<p>I don't understand anarcho-primitivism honestly. Why would we want to revert to when our species was barely surviving and struggling?</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-27T04:40:48.209000+00:00</p>
<p>It's more an indicator of the general despair and discontent amongst the population in the west more than anything else.</p>

<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-27T04:47:57.703000+00:00</p>
<p>The concept of power, something that has driven people to do the most horrific things to each other, most likely comes from the simple logic that being in control will often be linked to a greater ability to keep surviving.</p>
<p>No one wants to die. If we had a hard-coded death wish, we'd all have jumped off cliffs long before society was a thing. Surviving and reproducing are the two main evolutionary functions of any organism, only modern society makes these more subconscious amid a whirlwind of other human constructs. (Well, maybe not reproducing‚Ä¶modern society has seen fit to turn that into a giant political issue!)</p>
<p>As for the "return to monke" meme and those who take it seriously instead of treating it as a meme, I'd like to see how they would react to the society they take for granted being wiped off the face of the earth--what their immediate next steps would be, what about their families, etc.</p>

<p>By "returning to monke," all we would do is reintroduce the exact same dangers that our society was built to guard against.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-27T05:00:29.424000+00:00</p>
<p>Those people would probably do just that and jump off of a cliff if they were to sever all ties to modern civilization. It would be a perpetual never ending self destructive loop if we were to "return to monke." Since we would eventually wind up in the same place we are now. As for modern <em>society</em>? Yeah, we're fucked in that department. The traditional values and ethics that helped establish a moral compass have been perverted by the recent paradigm shift.</p>

<p>It's a simple fact of evolution that success is determined by how well an organism can survive, not how well the support of others in the group can make it survive without it having to do anything.</p>

<p>Traditional values and ethics all seem to have one thing in common--not the "hurr durr fundamentalism racist insanity" that you hear used to blast them all too often nowadays, but a work ethic and an understanding that we're only as good as we make ourselves.</p>

<p>I can‚Äôt really discuss right now, but on the subject of what Sharky mentioned in <#775135818423205892>, I think it‚Äôs worth talking about: can art be separated from its artist?</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-11-28T01:52:41.722000+00:00</p>
<p>how can it not? Once anything that's considered art enters the public eye, it's at the mercy of its perception of it</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-11-28T03:39:24.254000+00:00</p>
<p>It could possibly be inextricably tied to the artist if it is only ever seen in the context of the artist presenting it. And if that artist gives people a poor impression, they are not going to be as willing to let the art speak for itself.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-11-28T05:46:57.649000+00:00</p>

<p>Schopenhauer Saturday Quote:</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey tell us that Suicide is the greatest piece of Cowardice‚Ä¶ That Suicide is wrong; when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in this world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person.‚Äù</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-29T05:27:02.364000+00:00</p>
<p>On one hand, yes, every man has the right to live. That is the most fundamental human right.</p>
<p>On the other hand, does a man have the right to destroy what another created? After all, no man creates himself. Does he have the power to cause pain for those who cherish his presence?</p>
<p>And then there are matters of cowardice. I consider suicide to be cowardly because it doesn't actually solve problems. All things shall pass, both one's own life by nature, and a man's problems. Is it right that a man should use a permanent end to his own greatest gift as an attempt to solve his own temporary problems?</p>
<p>I'm reminded of a moment from the TV show <em>House</em> when Dr. House drugs his friend Dr. Wilson with propophol after Wilson, who has cancer, expresses a wish to not undergo chemo. House tells his friend after he wakes up, "this is what death is like. You experienced <em>nothing</em> for the past four hours." He then asks Wilson if he would really want that to be his certain fate now, when Wilson has a chance to survive. Indeed, anyone who has been under general anesthetic before (including me) knows that feeling of experiencing nothing. The difference, though, is that with anesthesia, you will wake up and return to the world. In death, one never wakes up. One simply experiences nothing for the rest of time. So it makes sense that some would try to use it as an escape: you experience no conflicts, no emotions, no pain. Yet "the joy of life is a very good thing," as Theodore Roosevelt wrote in his autobiography, and denying joy to both one's self and others doesn't sit well with me.</p>

<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-11-29T05:31:19.291000+00:00</p>

<p>I understand what you‚Äôre trying to say, but I don‚Äôt think the two statements coalesce very well. Water can be still as in a small pond, or as destructive as a tidal wave. </p>
<p>When one is told to ‚Äúbe like water‚Äù much like in Zen Buddhism, it is more so the idea of establishing equilibrium and avoiding rigidity in all matters. </p>
<p>However, I do agree that it is often better to be a nonconformist than not. It aids in opening new possibilities for independent thought that may have previously been suppressed because of social conventions.</p>

<p>This reminds me of something called the Tesla valve. It's designed to prevent any significant backflow from occurring. </p>
<p>Notice how part of the flow splits off and then collides with the main flow when it converges around the bend, essentially reducing the flow to almost nothing. Does this, I wonder, maybe reflect something in society? Where attempts to split off and be different in an organized way end up just returning to the mainstream and clashing in such a way as to go nowhere?</p>

<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-12-01T03:10:16.708000+00:00</p>
<p>Exactly. It‚Äôs foolish to believe that any revolution would remain underground for long, it‚Äôs very difficult to maintain anonymity in groups that large. Besides, the advertising industry already took full advantage of the ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù by using to sell records and soda.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as a non-conformist because human are, by nature, destined to seek somewhere to belong.</p>
<p>However, the way I intercepted my quote is that people with no individualism are destined to fall down hill like water because they have no personal values and there for just one of billions. It's those people that are willing to hold their ground like a rock or those who dare to climb the mountain that succeed in life</p>

<p>I agree to an extent. I also believe that as our lives progress, we tend to look back to certain times of our lives and think to ourselves that things were better then, even if we were saying the same thing <em>at that time</em>, and all of the times before that. And we do this until we die. I think this is a part of the human condition.</p>

<p>Yes, it helps to recalibrate your center of gravity and presence of mind. In defeat you‚Äôre able to identify and quantify the enemy and its various forces.</p>
<hr />

<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-12-12T08:00:04.246000+00:00</p>
<p>Yes. That's why I refer to retreat and flight as being two different things. Retreat, especially tactical withdrawals, signify a remainder in strength. Whereas flight is when you're in disorder, and are being forcefully routed from your position.</p>

<p>a retreat is calculated, so to speak. Whereas flight is just 'holy fucking shit, run away'</p>

<p>Theory Thursday‚Äôs Question is:</p>
<p>‚ÄúFamiliarity breeds contempt.‚Äù Do you agree or disagree with this statement? And why?</p>
<p><@&780240214483402762></p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-12-17T21:39:41.930000+00:00</p>
<p>It almost seems like when you heavily familiarize yourself with something or someone, whenever someone else who has done the same says something even slightly contradictory to what YOU think, it becomes a lot more contemptible in your mind, because you've dwelled on it so much.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-12-17T21:41:35.599000+00:00</p>
<p>I also think that when you‚Äôve heavily familiarized and involved yourself with someone or something, you come to form certain expectations and criteria for that person or thing in your mind and therefore any deviant behavior from it would be seen with outrage and contempt.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-12-17T21:44:21.730000+00:00</p>
<p>precisely. At least with other people who aren't so familiar with what you invest in, the divergence in opinions and ideals is a lot more tolerable and easier to understand. On the other hand, when you talk to someone who is familiar with what you're also familiar with, the divergence in opinions is less tolerable and is seen as being worse than someone elses opinions.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-12-17T21:49:45.579000+00:00</p>
<p>Part of that comes with our innate biases in regards to things we attach ourselves to. Whether it‚Äôs knowledge of a particular thing, or something trivial like a movie. When we meet others with the same interest, there are occasions where you both may grow contemptuous due to deeming the other‚Äôs knowledge of as lacking or incorrect.</p>
<p>Edit: Sorry for the typos. Typing with one hand right now.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-12-17T21:52:41.015000+00:00</p>
<p>It's ironic honestly. A lot of the time, people end up alienating people that have common interests with them more than people that have differing interests.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-12-17T21:54:14.248000+00:00</p>
<p><em>In essence, I completely agree with the statement above. Familiarity ABSOLUTELY breeds contempt</em></p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-12-17T21:55:37.676000+00:00</p>
<p>You see this quite often in music. The purists and elitists exercise their superiority complex over others and it alienated someone you could have potentially introduced to a new genre. Now mind you, I do think that there is valid criticism to be made towards objectively inferior things, but one must exercise tact when criticizing, lest you give off the wrong impression.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-12-17T22:01:26.568000+00:00</p>
<p>The issue arrives when people, no matter how concisely you make your argument, or how tactful you are, will dismiss your views as flawed and call you out on it. Elitism within a genre does nothing but <em>breed contempt</em> and prevent any serious, well thought-out dialogue.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-17T22:45:53.557000+00:00</p>
<p>Familiarity breeds contempt‚Äîas soon as you see someone‚Äôs weaknesses you lose a lot of respect for them.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-17T22:46:46.275000+00:00</p>
<p>Unless, of course, they knowingly brought their weaknesses to you.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-17T22:47:18.723000+00:00</p>

<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-17T22:53:03.370000+00:00</p>
<p>The irony is that those people have a tendency to preach wanting discourse, but when it actually starts and it‚Äôs not ‚Äúall hail the established one,‚Äù they try to shut it down.</p>

<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-12-17T23:01:32.148000+00:00</p>
<p>Those people NEED to preach wanting discourse, because it would be way too obvious that they don't want it if they didn't</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-12-17T23:04:37.082000+00:00</p>
<p>In my opinion, anyone that believes that familiarity doesn't somehow breed even the slightest contempt is either a fool, a jaded idealist, or has ulterior motives.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-12-17T23:05:30.976000+00:00</p>
<p>It's probably mostly jaded idealists.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-12-17T23:08:22.212000+00:00</p>
<p>Yes, you're probably correct. I also think that it is preferable to be a cynic than to be an idealist. The word cynic has also been misconstrued throughout colloquial use. For the cynics in ancient Greece, the purpose of life is to live in virtue, in agreement with nature.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-12-17T23:08:41.119000+00:00</p>
<p>To be an idealist is to do nothing but await inevitable disappointment.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-12-17T23:09:33.604000+00:00</p>
<p>I guess being a total optimist has its drawbacks‚Ä¶</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-12-17T23:10:39.466000+00:00</p>
<p>I think that pragmatic optimism is excusable, but to be a total optimist is to live with disappointment at every turn.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-12-17T23:15:39.448000+00:00</p>
<p>I think that this also depends on the individual, and how much you trust them. I typically find such willfully open and deliberate revelations dubious.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-17T23:23:42.091000+00:00</p>
<p>Among others, yes</p>

<p>Seems there's a bit too much familiarity in the community, huh?</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-17T23:25:53.356000+00:00</p>
<p>As far as these elitists are concerned, one relative newcomer is as worthless as the next. So when they are faced with people who see through them, they are <em>terrified.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-12-17T23:27:01.702000+00:00</p>
<p>they're completely petrified of being challenged on their narrative, so they need to resort to mental gymnastics to get their way</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-17T23:29:08.068000+00:00</p>
<p>Probably the nastiest way I've seen this occur is simple gaslighting--make people question their own very valid points by pretending they make no sense. All the entrenched people seem to practice this regularly.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-12-17T23:30:43.964000+00:00</p>
<p>That kind of shit is really scummy. It doesn't do literally anybody justice in the end.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-12-17T23:31:37.235000+00:00</p>
<p>Which is why I believe that these people ought to be routed from their entrenchment. It's times like these when one must <em>act</em> and not dither about concerning oneself with bureaucracy.</p>
<hr />
<p>Duckington#1138 at 2020-12-17T23:33:10.513000+00:00</p>
<p>Uprooting them from their entrenchment is easier said than done of course. In many cases, it's even impossible</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-17T23:34:10.639000+00:00</p>
<p>The most surefire way to do it is by building a new community that shuts them out, and that's not easy by any stretch.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-12-17T23:34:16.741000+00:00</p>

<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-12-17T23:37:19.252000+00:00</p>

<p>A chat with a friend resulted in his claim that there cannot be a revolution under current circumstances, due to the political climate regarding just about anything. However, I simply had to disagree saying that these people are truly the epitome of the vocal minority. The majority, the rest of us, have had it with these degenerate shenanigans and would like nothing more than to see these idiots disappear. </p>
<p>The issue comes with lack of leadership, there is no figurehead for the revolution, no one to spur a cult of personality. Along with that is the general laziness and complacency of so many that would like a <em>convenient</em> revolution, that doesn't involve them directly, something that they can observe from the comfort of the sidelines.</p>

"When it comes to works of art, why is the original more valuable than a duplicate?"</p>

<p>Whoa, that second article is long. But it explains the first one for sure</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-19T20:05:02.192000+00:00</p>
<p>The original was made as the artist wanted, with the artist's touch. In this way, there is a certain degree to which the essence of the artist is found in the original.</p>
<p>Whereas duplicates can be made simply by copying the interpretation of the original, the original had no such guide. It is the only example of that art to have been made with real artistry.</p>
<p>This also comes down to societal values: we tend to be more individualistic over here, and it shows. We value preserving the product of the individual's work, rather than relying on the idea of "might as well keep it going with copies, for even if the original gets lost we have a record of the interpretation."</p>
<p>It's curious, though‚Ä¶no one bats an eye at a published edition of a piece of classical music, but the original manuscripts are considered priceless (even though, in the case of Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin, the manuscripts nearly ended up as pastry wrappings!). There is a certain connection to the artist found in the original that a copy just cannot provide.</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-12-19T20:14:10.258000+00:00</p>
<p>I do think that in order to properly assess this, we must detach ourselves from societal precepts established here in the West, for as you've mentioned, the cultural zeitgeist in the West is far more individualistic, preferring compartmentalization and scrutiny of the <em>parts.</em> Whereas in the East it tends to emphasize the <em>whole</em>. </p>
<p>Personally, I believe that while yes, the original may contain traces of the artist, I tend to believe that the work itself is more important, and therefore should be preserved. When I write a song, I realize that whilst there were of course inspirations for the music, once it is released to the public, it no longer much matters, rather the interpretations of the work begin to encompass it. </p>
<p>However I do believe there is merit to the quote, </p>
<p>"Do not seek to follow in the footsteps of the wise, seek what <em>they sought</em>."</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-19T20:15:11.674000+00:00</p>
<p>Let us also consider digital art, which has no original because it‚Äôs an array of bytes that can be replicated infinitely. So all that exists of a digital work of art is the interpretation by the viewer.</p>
<p>In that case, if we value old objects so much, are we really looking to preserve the value of the work, or the tangible, physical nature of the object itself?</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-19T20:16:54.872000+00:00</p>
<p>It is often said that art is meant to get people thinking and questioning.</p>
<p>That can be done without the original object. So in theory, a copy is every bit as much of a work of art as the original.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-19T20:17:19.472000+00:00</p>
<p>The idea it conveys is the same.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-19T20:18:05.798000+00:00</p>
<p>Returning to the subject of music, I suppose that is also something a bit different, as it's worth nothing if it's never played. The sound is new from iteration to iteration, depending on who plays it. All that the composer left is notes on a page as a framework for musicians to interpret.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-19T20:18:57.568000+00:00</p>
<p>And then you have lost works that may never be found, potential masterworks locked away in a cabinet somewhere. Those are only worth something if found and used.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-19T20:19:56.027000+00:00</p>
<p>Worth nothing artistically, though if found they would be sold as old things</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-19T20:23:10.955000+00:00</p>
<p>The question was ‚Äúwhy is the original more valuable,‚Äù but I think I can now ask an opposing question: When is the copy more valuable, and why?</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-19T20:25:12.323000+00:00</p>
<p>And in what sense do we define value?</p>
<hr />
<p>TheContingencyMan#4708 at 2020-12-20T02:20:38.962000+00:00</p>
<p>I believe that the copy becomes more valuable when it has contributed equally or more than the original, or in some cases brought to the world's attention the <em>existence</em> of the original. In this instance I think that we are defining value via societal and cultural significance and contribution.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T02:28:32.423000+00:00</p>
<p>I was just thinking, when paintings or structures are restored from horrible states of disrepair, usually artists are brought in to fill in the missing pieces. At that point a large part of the restoration is actually a replica that makes the work artistically viable again.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T02:47:07.275000+00:00</p>
<p>Also, we keep coming back to music, and I think that's a case where the copy can be more valuable than the original</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T02:47:47.711000+00:00</p>
<p>After all, there are two types of copies of sheet music:</p>
<ol>
<li>A photocopy of the manuscript</li>
<li>A typeset edition</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T02:48:03.240000+00:00</p>
<p>With both of those, it becomes unnecessary to have the original manuscript</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T02:49:49.047000+00:00</p>
<p>Bach's Sonatas and Partitas are a prime example of that</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T02:52:33.236000+00:00</p>
<p>Ivan Galamian's edition of the work, published by the International Music Company, has two parts: his typeset, edited edition (which I and many other violinists use), and a facsimile of Bach's manuscript. That allows for the dual purpose of reading the notes clearly and seeing Bach's original marks, which can often convey a lot about the intended sound. And the result is that I get a complete picture of the music as Bach wrote it without having the original manuscript in front of me.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T02:52:59.087000+00:00</p>
<p>Projects like IMSLP, which is a library of free scores, help to advance the idea of copies being more valuable than the original.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T02:53:42.161000+00:00</p>
<p>Everything on that site is a copy. But those are the versions that can spread like wildfire because they are free.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T02:53:54.333000+00:00</p>
<p>As with any wiki, there are some quality issues.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T02:54:19.616000+00:00</p>
<p>But there are also some truly golden reproductions of the original music buried deep in IMSLP's database.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T02:55:05.870000+00:00</p>
<p>A lot of Vivaldi concertos, for example, are available in two forms: the manuscript, and the typeset version on IMSLP.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T02:55:42.584000+00:00</p>
<p>I then wonder, how valuable is the original if I can get the music right here?</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T02:59:29.427000+00:00</p>
<p>But we have this addiction to feasting our eyes on the real deal, the OG, the actual work.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T02:59:41.154000+00:00</p>
<p>Everything I've been saying so far devalues the original</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T03:00:01.627000+00:00</p>
<p>Yet it doesn't explain why we value the original so much</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T03:00:17.973000+00:00</p>
<p>And I think that first article makes a good point about tourism</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T03:00:39.973000+00:00</p>
<p>The idea of having one true original is based on scarcity</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T03:00:56.407000+00:00</p>
<p>A time-tested economic principle</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T03:01:46.642000+00:00</p>
<p>And if you can convince people to come see the original, the one and only, you can reap the benefits</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T03:01:58.167000+00:00</p>
<p>This is not to say that I think this is a bad thing</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T03:02:26.120000+00:00</p>
<p>I'm just spinning my wheels on why it's a good thing</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-20T03:05:01.208000+00:00</p>
<p>There is also the historical value of the original. We can see subtleties in it, details that may tell us quite a bit, that would get lost in a copy.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-20T03:05:29.964000+00:00</p>
<p>If a painting is in fact done over a long-lost masterpiece, a copy of the overlaid work won't show us the lost one.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T03:05:44.901000+00:00</p>
<p>That's true too</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T03:06:37.307000+00:00</p>
<p>Now, if you copy the overlaid one then strip it off the original, then you have both‚Ä¶aha, and the overlaid work no longer exists in its original incarnation, but rather as a copy</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T03:08:59.936000+00:00</p>
<p>Then some might say, "oh no, the original of the overlay was lost!"</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T03:09:20.597000+00:00</p>
<p>And then you have a debate going: was it worth removing the overlay to get to the painting underneath?</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T03:10:07.737000+00:00</p>
<p>I suppose the idea of preserving an original is inconvenient for when other interests arise</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T03:10:33.679000+00:00</p>
<p>Whereas in Asian cultures where the original is not as valuable, that's not a problem</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-20T04:51:47.897000+00:00</p>
<p>In Asian cultures it also seems like there is a certain element of the art still being "alive" when it's copied or repaired, much like music.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-20T04:52:10.755000+00:00</p>
<p>Sure, the original existed, but people are continuing to ensure that the beauty of it remains.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-20T04:53:21.006000+00:00</p>
<p>So the value of the original is more sentimental and useful for a close study, which can be quite revealing, but the artistic value is increased as copies are made.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T07:27:53.880000+00:00</p>
<p>The concept of life and death is different in Western cultures</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T07:28:13.683000+00:00</p>
<p>Here, we think of life as a line: Birth -&gt; Life -&gt; Death.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T07:28:53.819000+00:00</p>
<p>In this paradigm, when someone dies, that's it for them. Sure, you may believe in an afterlife, but there is no reincarnation.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T07:29:51.211000+00:00</p>
<p>Thus, when the original example of a work of art is lost, it has "died." According to the Western paradigm, it is therefore gone, and reproductions are merely pretenders posing as the real thing.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T07:30:35.559000+00:00</p>
<p>Now, in Eastern cultures, life is though of as a circle: Birth -&gt; Life -&gt; Death -&gt; Reincarnation.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T07:31:12.744000+00:00</p>
<p>So when the original example of a work of art is lost, it has also died, but then it is reborn as a copy.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T07:31:49.453000+00:00</p>
<p>Both of these interpretations stem from the same central concept: that art is alive.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T07:33:13.364000+00:00</p>
<p>(I'm thinking "out loud" here)</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T07:33:27.427000+00:00</p>
<p>Art is represented in inanimate objects</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T07:34:40.378000+00:00</p>
<p>It is alive in that some part of its creator went into its creation, and thus one could argue that it is one being with its creator.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T07:35:16.575000+00:00</p>
<p>But it is also alive in that some part of the viewer goes into beholding the art, and thus one could argue that it is one being with its beholder.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T07:37:17.422000+00:00</p>
<p>If that is true, then the beholder's beliefs on life and death are inherently projected onto the idea of the art.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T07:37:41.400000+00:00</p>
<p>And that is why, in Western cultures, the original piece is so valued.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T07:38:50.333000+00:00</p>
<p>We in the West define life as when the body is alive, and death as when the body is dead.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T07:39:21.570000+00:00</p>
<p>We are aware of the notion of someone "living on" in works and memories, but we still consider dead people to be dead.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T07:39:55.778000+00:00</p>
<p>We don't really take that notion of living on to heart in the same way that Buddhists and others, who follow the circular paradigm of life, do.</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T07:44:15.254000+00:00</p>
<p>And so when we have the original piece, we consider it to be alive</p>
<hr />
<p>FifiTheBulldog#6153 at 2020-12-20T07:44:42.598000+00:00</p>
<p>But when the original is gone, even if the spirit of the piece has been perfectly preserved, we still consider the work to be dead</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-20T19:15:22.009000+00:00</p>
<p>And as for the circular paradigm of life, we can see an example of this in how the earth itself works, visualized in plate tectonics.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-20T19:16:18.245000+00:00</p>
<p>At subduction zones, old parts of the crust that may hold evidence of long-past things slip below the surface and melt back into the mantle.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-20T19:17:39.045000+00:00</p>
<p>But at the same time, thousands of miles away, new plates form in quiet places, often deep underwater.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-20T19:19:06.086000+00:00</p>
<p>Eventually these too will slip under after a long journey and be replaced.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-20T19:23:44.814000+00:00</p>
<p>Meanwhile, all species eventually come to an end, since there is a limit to how long they can sustain survival before forces of nature edge them out of existence.</p>
<hr />
<p>CrabbyUnderARock#1950 at 2020-12-20T19:24:11.016000+00:00</p>
<p>So whether we view life as a circle or a line depends on how long-term we‚Äôre looking.</p>
